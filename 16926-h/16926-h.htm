<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>Preface</h2>


<p>It is more difficult to sell a good book by a new
author than it is to sell a poor one by a popular
author, because the good book by the new author
must make its way against great odds. It must
assert itself personally, and succeed by its own efforts.
The book by the popular author flies without wings,
as it were. The one by the well-known author has
a valuable asset in its creator; the one by the new
author has no asset but its own merits.</p>

<p>I am not contending by the above that this is a
good book; far from it. Some books, however, having
very little literary recommendation, may be interesting
in other ways.</p>

<p>There are several things instrumental in making
for the success of a book: first, the fame of the
author; second, the originality of the theme or style;
third, the extent of the advertising scheme, and
fourth, the proximity of the subject matter to the
heart and home of the reader; and this last is the
reason for the "Skookum Chuck Fables."</p><div><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span></a></div>

<p>If the following stories are not literature, they
are spiced with familiar local sounds and sights, and
they come very close to every family fireside in
British Columbia. For this reason I hope to see a
copy in every home in the province.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Rolling_Stone" id="Of_the_Rolling_Stone"></a>Of the Rolling Stone</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in a small village in Bruce
County, Province of Ontario, Dominion of Canada,
there lived a man who was destined to establish a
precedent. He was to prove to the world that a
rolling stone is capable at times of gathering as
much moss as a stationary one, and how it is possible
for the rock with St. Vitus dance to become more
coated than the one that is confined to perpetual isolation.
Like most iconoclasts he was of humble birth,
and had no foundation upon which to rest the cornerstone
of his castle, which was becoming too heavy for
his brain to support much longer.</p>

<p>His strong suit was his itinerate susceptibility;
but his main anchorage was his better five-fifths.
One of his most monotonous arguments was to the
effect that the strenuousness of life could only be
equalled by the monotony of it, and that it was a
pity we had to do so much in this world to get so
little out of it.</p>

<p>"Why should a man be anchored to one spot of the
geographical distribution like a barnacle to a ship
during the whole of his mortal belligerency?" he one
day asked his wife. "We hear nothing, see nothing,
become nothing, and our system becomes fossilized,
antediluvian. Why not see everything, know everything?
Life is hardly worth while, but since we are
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span></a> here we may as well feed from the choicest fruits,
and try for the first prizes."</p>

<p>Now, his wife was one of those happy, contented,
sweet, make-the-best-of-it-cheerily persons who never
complained even under the most trying circumstances.
It is much to the detriment of society that
the variety is not more numerous, but we are not here
to criticise the laws that govern the human nature of
the ladies. This lady was as far remote from her
husband in temperament as Venus is from Neptune.
He was darkness, she was daylight; and the patience
with which she tolerated him in his dark moods was
beautiful though tragic. It was plain that she loved
him, for what else in a woman could overlook such
darkness in a man?</p>

<p>"You see," he would say, "it is like this. Here
I am slaving away for about seventy-five dollars per
month, year in and year out. All I get is my food
and clothing&mdash;and yours, of course, which is as much
necessary, but is more or less of a white man's
burden. No sooner do I get a dollar in my hand
than it has to be passed along to the butcher, baker,
grocer, dressmaker, milliner. Are our efforts worth
while when we have no immediate prospects of improvement?
And then the monotony of the game:
eat, sleep, work; eat, sleep, work. And the environs
are as monotonous as the occupations. I think man
was made for something more, although a very small
percentage are ever so fortunate as to get it. Now, I
can make a mere living by roaming about from place
to place as well as I can by sitting down glued to this
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span></a>spot that I hate, and then I will have the chance of
falling into something that is a great deal better, and
have an opportunity to see something, hear something,
learn something. Here I am dying by inches, unwept,
unhonoured and unsung."</p>

<p>To be "blue" was his normal condition. His sky
was always cloudy, and with this was mingled a disposition
of weariness which turned him with disgust
from all familiar objects. With him "familiarity
bred contempt." One day when his psychological
temperament was somewhat below normal the pent
up thunder in him exploded and the lightning was
terrible:</p>

<p>"Here I am rooted to one spot," he said, "fossilized,
stagnant, wasting away, dead to the whole world
except this one little acre. And what is there here?
Streets, buildings, trees, fences, hills, water. Nothing
out of the ordinary; and so familiar, they have become
hateful. Why, everything in the environment
breeds weariness, monotony, a painfully disgusting
sameness. The same things morning, noon and night,
year after year. Why, the very names of the people
here give me nervous prostration. Just think&mdash;Cummings,
Huston, Sanson, Austin, Ward, McAbee,
Hobson, Bailey, Smith, Black, Brown, White&mdash;Bah!
the sound of them is like rumors of a plague. I want
to flee from them. I want to hear new names ringing
in my ears. And I hate the faces no less than I do
the names. I would rather live on a prairie where
you expect nothing; and get it&mdash;anything so long as
it is new."</p><p><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span></a></p>

<p>Now, that which is hereditary with the flesh cannot
be a crime. The victim is more to be pitied in
his ancestral misfortune, and the monkey from which
our hero sprang must have been somewhat cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>Of course his wife had heard such outbreaks of
insanity from him before, so she only laughed, thinking
to humor him back to earth again with her love
and smiles.</p>

<p>"Conditions are not so bad in Bruce county as you
paint them," she said, "and if you do not go about
sniffing the air you will not find so many obnoxious
perfumes. Why, I <i>love</i> the locality; and I like the
people. And I like you, and my home; and I am
perfectly satisfied with everything. Things might
be a great deal worse. You should have no complaint
to make. You have a steady situation, a good
master, a beautiful home, plenty to eat&mdash;and then you
have me," she exclaimed, as though her presence
should atone for all else in the world that he did not
have. And perhaps a treasure of this kind should
have been a valuable asset, and an antidote against
all mere mundane cares.</p>

<p>"Look out through the parlor door," she continued.
"Could anything be more beautiful? The sun is
just setting. The lake is asleep. See the reflection
of the trees beneath its surface. How peaceful, how
restful! My mind is just like the lake&mdash;perfectly at
ease. Why do you not control your storm and calm
down like the lake? Look at the tall shadows of the
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span></a>contented firs reaching away out across its bosom.
How like a dream."</p>

<p>"Bah! Don't mention lake to me. I hate the
sight of it. I have seen it too long. It is too familiar.
It is an eyesore to me. I am weary of it all. I want
a rest. Here comes Brown now. Let me hide in
the cellar. It would be hypocrisy to remain here and
smile welcome to him when I hate the sight of his
physiognomy and detest the sound of his name. No,
he has gone by. He does not intend to call. Thank
heaven. Five minutes of his society would be equal
to ten years in purgatory. New sights, new scenes,
new voices, new faces; all these are recreation to a
mentally weary constitution."</p>

<p>"I would consider it a crime to leave this beauty
spot," said his wife, "and it is a sin against heaven
to decry it."</p>

<p>"Then I am a sinner and a criminal," said the
hereditary crank, "because I hate it and am going to
leave. I will take fifty dollars and go, and if I do
not return with fifty thousand I will eat myself. I
have said all there is to say. Those dull, uninteresting
faces give me the nighthorse. I am going to-morrow.
Of course you remain, because it is more
expensive to travel double than single," he snorted,
"and I have not the plunks."</p>

<p>He embarked into the big world a few days later
with his wife's warm kiss burning his lips&mdash;faithful
even in his unfaithfulness. She was cheerful for
some time, thinking that he would return, but the
magnetism which attracted him to the woman whom
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span></a>he had picked from among the swarming millions
was of very inferior voltage.</p>

<p>He wandered about Canada and the United States
for about two years. He had many ups and downs.
On the average he made enough to induce his soul
to remain in his body in anticipation of something
better. To do him justice he remitted all odd coin to
his wife in Bruce county, and he wrote saying he was
perfectly happy in his new life. He awoke one morning
and found himself in the "Best" Hotel, Ashcroft,
British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, and
the first thing he saw was the sand-hill. He thought
Ashcroft was the most desolate looking spot he had
ever seen. It looked like a town that had been
located in a hurry and had been planted by mistake
on the wrong site.</p>

<p>He fell in with a Bruce county fellow there who
was running a general store, and they became very
friendly. He secured employment from this friend,
who proved to be a philanthropist.</p>

<p>"I have a proposition to make to you," the friend
said one day.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the iconoclast.</p>

<p>"Buy me out," said the philanthropist. "I have
all the money I can carry. When the rainy day
comes I will be well in out of the drip, and my
tombstone will be 'next best' in the cemetery."</p>

<p>"But I have no bank balance," said the aspirant
eagerly. "I have no debentures of any kind; I have
not even pin money."</p><p><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span></a></p>

<p>"Bonds are unnecessary," said the friend. "Besides,
when I sell you this stock and building you
will have an asset in the property. I will sell outright,
take a mortgage for the balance, which you
will disburse at the rate of five hundred dollars per
year. You can do it and make money at the same
time. You will kill two birds with half a stone.
Why, in twenty years' time Rockefeller will be asking
you to endorse his notes."</p>

<p>The sale was made and the hero jumped into a
store on Railway Avenue without a seed or cell, and
in a short time the moss began to grow so thick upon
him that he had all the sharks in B.C. asking him
for a coating. And then he wrote for his wife, whom
he missed for the first time. The letter ran thus:</p>

<p>
"Ultima Thule, B.C., March 1st. 1915.<br />
<br />
"My Dear Wife:<br />
</p>

<p>"You will see by the heading of this letter that
fortune has cast me off at Ashcroft, and I must congratulate
myself for initiating that rolling stone
'stunt.' I have stumbled upon the richest mine in
B.C. The gold is sticking out of it in chunks. The
auto that you will play when you arrive will be a
'hum dinger' and no mistake. I am enclosing my
cheque for $500. Buy out Tim Eaton and bring
your dear self here, for I am lonely without you.</p>

<p>
"Your hitherto demented husband."<br />
</p><p><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span></a></p>

<p>She read it fifty times, placed it next her heart and
pranced about like a five-year-old. "Now, just where
is Ashcroft?" she soliloquized. None of the Bruce
county aborigines seemed to know, so she consulted a
world map, and she found it growing like a parasite
to the Canadian Pacific Railway away in among the
mountains of British Columbia.</p>

<p>But this was nothing. She would have risked a
journey over the Atlantic in an aeroplane if it were
a means of uniting her with the man who was the
only masculine human in existence so far as she was
concerned&mdash;the man whom she had singled out and
adopted from among the millions of his kind. When
they met the union was pathetic, but it was lovely.
To make a woman happy, who loves you like this,
should be the consummation of a man's domestic
ambitions.</p>

<p>It was pointed out to him afterwards that, after
all, the moss did not begin to grow until he had
settled down in Ashcroft. So he lost his knighthood
as an iconoclast.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_Cultus_Johnny" id="Of_Cultus_Johnny"></a>Of Cultus Johnny</h2>


<p>Once upon a time at Spence's Bridge, County of
Yale, Province of British Columbia, on the Indian
reserve, there lived two Indians named Cultus (bad)
Johnny and Hias (big) Peter. They were friends
until Peter got married, and then the trouble
began, because they both wanted the same klootchman.
They had been fishing for some time for
the same fish, in the same pool in the Thompson
river, and had each been favored with very encouraging
nibbles. One day, however, Peter felt the tugging
at his bait somewhat stronger than usual and
with one jerk he pulled out his fish. Peter had
stolen a march on his rival. The priest married them
when Johnny was at the coast, fishing at New Westminster
for the canneries. When the intelligence
reached him he sat down in the bottom of the boat
and for a few moments imagined himself at Spence's
Bridge giving Hias Peter a Jack Johnson trouncing.
To Cultus Johnny the strange preference of this
woman for his rival seemed like unmitigated discrimination.
Why, there was no comparison between the
two when it came to worldly icties. Peter had nothing:
he had no illiha, no icties of any kind; he was
broke morning, noon and night. Johnny had a sixty
dollar saddle, a five dollar bridle, a two and a half
quirt and the best cayuse in Spence's Bridge, and
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]</span></a>worth seventy-five dollars. Peter had nothing but
the wage he earned working on the C.P.R. section,
which had been just enough to supply him with his
daily muck-a-muck (food) before marriage. How he
calculated to feed two with the one basket of o-lil-ies
(berries) which had been only large enough for one,
did not seem to worry the community, as such things
were taking place every day and were a common
occurrence, and the klootchman always seemed to
survive the ordeal. And it must not be forgotten
that Johnny had a seven and a half Stetson hat while
all Peter could afford was a two bit cap.</p>

<p>It will always remain a mystery why one Indian
should be more voluptuous, or gather more icties
about him than another, when none of them have any
visible assets from which to derive an income. Unless
it be that the more voluptuous Indian works every
day of his weary, aimless life, spends nothing, and
hoards the residual balance like a miser, lives on the
old man before marriage, and on his klootchman after,
we are unable to arrive at a solution. No one knew
by what means Johnny had acquired all his wealth.
Perhaps he had bought all his luxuries on jaw-bone
from one store while he paid cash for his muck-a-muck
in another. There is one thing certain, the
honest Indian is always the poorest, and in these
days of the high cost of beans and bacon and rice, he
has to be poorer to be more honest. Now it came to
pass that one day Johnny balanced his saddle, horse,
quirt and Stetson hat with Peter's nothing and argued
that all the weight was in his own favor. The keeka
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]</span></a>(girl) had made a mistake. And to a man who
measured everything by worldly icties this was sound
argument, for the only big thing about Peter was
his avoirdupois&mdash;barring his heart, of course. In
the heat of his argument Johnny determined to deprive
Peter of his sacred property. And among the
Indians this is not nearly so hazardous or hopeless
or criminal an undertaking as it may seem through
an Anglo-Saxon microscope. Although a wife is considerable
of an asset to a white man, she is not so to
an Indian; and it may be to his advantage that he is
more or less philosophical about it. The cultus
Indian was at Lillooet when this skookum tumtum
(good thought) occurred to him. He was cutting
fire-wood with some of the Statlemulth (Lillooet
Indians) in an effort to heal the wound in his left
chest which had been left gaping since his recent
defeat in battle. He went back to Spence's Bridge
as fast as his seventy-five dollar cayuse, his sixty
dollar saddle, his five dollar bridle and his two and a
half quirt could carry him, and presented himself to
his kith and kin. The old man gave him a warm
hand-shake. They killed some fatted chickens and
had the biggest time that the rancherie had ever
known. Peter and his schmamch (wife) were there
and old acquaintances were renewed. Johnny's
strong suit with his ancient flame was his personal
icties; and when Peter was otherwise engaged he
asked the girl to elope with him to Kamloops or
Lillooet. The next day was Sunday and Peter was
going out with others on a cayuse hunt which had
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span></a>been planned some time before. He invited Johnny
because it would not be safe to leave him in possession
of the fort, and in charge of such a valuable,
though fickle, asset; for a great number of the Indian
women are fickle.</p>

<p>But Cultus Johnny declined the invitation. He
was tired, and wanted to rest. Besides, he had a
bridle to finish which he was plaiting from the leather
cut from the legs of an old pair of cow-boy boots
which he had found; it would be worth ten dollars
when finished. In spite of his good intentions Johnny
spent the whole day in idleness at the home of Mrs.
Peter; and, as it is no insult among the Indians for
a buck to propose an elopement with his neighbor's
wife, because it is a very common business transaction
among them, Johnny again suggested the escapade.
The woman only laughed and seemed to enjoy
the flirtation. But she would neither consent nor refuse.
Hias Peter did not return that evening, and the
next day Johnny was at the works with greater cannonading,
and with more skookum tumtum than ever,
and this time he was braver. He was just on the
point of putting his arm around the keeka's waist
when the door opened and Peter darkened the opening.
They looked at one another for a few moments
like two panthers about to spring at each other's
throats. Hias Peter had a hias gun, and he raised
it to his shoulder and glanced in a very savage and
threatening way along the barrel toward Cultus
Johnny's heart. Johnny dropped to the floor and
begged for mercy. Now it requires some courage to
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span></a>shoot a fellow-being down in cold blood, although the
punishment may be well deserved, so Peter lowered
his rifle.</p>

<p>"Klatawa!" (Go!) he commanded. "Hiak!"
(Quick!) he shouted. Johnny crawled on his hands
and knees towards the door, and as he was creeping
over the threshold Peter gave him one awful kick
that sent him rolling on the ground outside. And
turning to the woman: "Fooled!" he roared. "I
will shoot you down like a coyote next time," he said.
As the Indian is a man of few words, he drew himself
up to his hias (large) size in front of her. But the
woman pleaded that she was not to blame. Johnny
had persisted in his attentions to her, and she could
not drive him off. "If you want to get rid of him,
shoot him," said Peter.</p>

<p>Now, among the Indians, when you covet your
neighbor's wife, or have been too familiar with her,
and you are caught with the goods, you do not fly
into a far country for fear of your life. You still
hang around, and the worst you can get is perhaps
a pounding from the jealous neighbor; and the sweet
environment is worth the risk.</p>

<p>Johnny's skookum tumtum was somewhat out of
commission for a while. When he met Mrs. Peter
on the street after that they grinned at each other a
few times without speaking; and by and by, when
they thought Peter was out of sight, they would stop
and talk for a while. He asked her again to fly to
Kamloops with him, and she seemed to be swinging
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span></a>on the balance. Johnny dwelt upon his worldly assets&mdash;his
saddle, his bridle, and all his skookum icties.
Peter soon realized that his wife was eating at his
table and living in another man's tumtum, but he
kept on chewing his beans and bacon and dried soquas
(salmon) in silence, and, but for the intervention of
Providence, Peter might have followed in the footsteps
of Paul Spintlum.</p>

<p>One day Cultus Johnny and his sister went across
the river to fish. They cast their nets directly across
from the rancherie, beneath an angry-looking, hungry,
threatening, overhanging gravel bed. He and his
father and his father's fathers had fished there time
out of memory. The old men of the village were
squatted here and there weaving nets for the fishing
season. Squaws were bringing in bundles of tree
branches on their backs for firewood; others were
scraping the flesh from raw deer-skins, stretched on
frames which leaned against buildings. Some young
fellows, among whom was Hias Peter, were rolling
up driftwood from the river. Children were capering
about, laughing and shouting. Dogs were barking,
cats mewing, roosters crowing. There was nothing
but joy, and peace, and harmony. It was just such
a scene as may be witnessed on a bright sunny day at
any Indian village in the dry-belt at any time. Suddenly
there was a rush and a roar and a plunge of
waters. The whole mountain across from the rancherie
had fallen into the river with one mad roar like
thunder, and the water was thrown up upon the
village and its helpless inmates. In a moment the
peaceful scene was one of death and torture. Men,
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span></a>women and children were struggling helplessly in the
water and trying in vain to reach the higher benches.
At the next moment the water receded and carried
many back struggling into the channel of the river.
Hias Peter found himself, with others, struggling
among logs, timbers and debris of every description.
Just before the water receded he saw his wife and
heard her yell for help. He seized her skirt and
dragged her to safety, clinging to a friendly sage
brush. For a moment Peter thought that, so far as
he was personally concerned, she was scarcely worth
saving; but it is very unnatural to allow a fellow
being to drown before your eyes and make no attempt
to save him. And perhaps our worst enemy could
rely on us for protection under similar circumstances.
But where was Cultus Johnny and his sister all this
time? The whole world lay on top of them, and that
is all we know. They were never seen again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peter looked across the river and sighed.</p>

<p>Mr. Peter looked across the river and gave a grunt
in his own language.</p>

<p>A million tons of earth were holding down Cultus
Johnny.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Booby_Man" id="Of_the_Booby_Man"></a>Of the Booby Man</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in Ashcroft there lived a "gink"
who was very much wrapped up in himself. At a
local social function he took the prize one day for
being the most unpopular man in the community;
and this caused him to sit up nights, and study himself
as others saw him flitting across his unattractive
and uneventful stage. The winning of this prize
spoke to him with greater accent than could the exploding
of a sixteen-inch German gun, and it sent a
quiver through his entire avoirdupois. It was not
only an appalling revelation to him to know that he
was unpopular, but it was a disgrace to his pedigree
right back to the days of Samuel De Champlain, so
he began to paw the bunch grass and seek revenge.
First he dug among the archives of history for a solution.
There must be some reason for this disgraceful
blur on his life pages. Why was he the most unpopular
man on these sand downs? Why was he an
outcast? Why was he the Job of Ashcroft society?
Now, just why was he unpopular? Had he boils, like
Job? Was he an undesirable citizen? Was he a
German, or an Austrian, or a Turk? Was he inflicted
with some loathsome disease? Was he a
plague? Had some false reputation preceded him
into the community? Had he a cantankerous disposition?
Was he repulsive in appearance? Was he
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span></a>mean, stingy? Was he stupid, ignorant, uneducated,
brainless? No, personally he could not plead guilty
of acquaintance with any of the above disqualifications.
Among the archives of his past Ashcroft history
he found some tell-tale manuscripts, the contents
of which had never appealed to him until after the
booby prize episode. In plain English, he found
written facts which were as bold as the violation of
Belgian neutrality. Incidents which had seemed
very commonplace and unworthy of notice before, now
loomed up on those pages and presented themselves to
him as giants of the utmost importance. For instance,
in looking up the records connected with the forming
of the Ashcroft Rinks he found that he had
not been consulted in the matter. His name was
missing from that interesting page of Ashcroft history.
However, when the time arrived for the forming
of a company to finance the erection of the building,
great interest was taken in his bank account, and
the promoters knocked very early one morning at his
door seeking endorsement to purchase shares in the
joint stock company which was about to be born. At
the meeting for the election of directors to take
charge of the affairs of the company he was again
surrounded by the same zero atmosphere. He was
not even nominated as a prospective member. His
name had never been suggested. He was never consulted
when anything serious was the point of debate.
It had not occurred to him to become incensed at this
frigid zone attitude on the part of his associates. He
had not been expecting any handout, so he was not
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 26]</span></a>disappointed. He had been too much absorbed in his
own personal affairs, too much wrapped up in himself,
and could detect no grounds for offence. At the
annual election of officers for the Curlers, although
a member for ten years, it had never occurred to
any in the association to suggest his name as a
probable pillar for the upholding of the business
portion of the club. Again his presence was not suspected,
and he may as well have been in Iceland.
Although present incarnate, he was to all intent and
purpose only in the invisible spirit.</p>

<p>When the hospital idea was being introduced
the social thermometer in the vicinity was again
standing at the zero point; and he remembered
that he had never had the honor of being invited by
the society to any of the annual pioneer banquets. He
had received the alien "hand-out" upon all occasions,
and had the same status in the community as a
Chinaman. Of course, being hitherto so much
wrapped up in personality, he took no notice of his
social mercury, which always stood at its minimum.
And then, as the management of the various institutions
had been placed in hands which were, undoubtedly,
more able and willing to cope with the difficulties
than he, and as everybody seemed satisfied,
there was no occasion for him raising his voice in
protest throughout the dumb wilderness. Being personally
very much occupied with his own stamp mill,
and the percentage of the pay-rock, he was just as
pleased that no local burden should be placed across
the apex of his spinal pillar. But now he had
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]</span></a>arrived at a point where the road divided. New
scenes must be introduced into his play&mdash;new machinery
installed. Through the microscope he saw
that present conditions could not be allowed to prevail.
He was losing much valuable mineral over the
dump. He was angry. The sensitiveness of his
nature had received a shock; he had been shown up
as the most unpopular man in Ashcroft. It was time
for him to have the mercury brought near to the fire.
The next time prizes were being handed around his
arm would be the longest, and his voice the loudest;
and they would not be booby prizes neither. He had
known men of a few weeks standing only, rise to the
very apex of popularity, while he, with his ten years
initiation, had not yet developed brains enough, in
the estimation of the Ashcroft people, that would
justify them in placing in his charge the management
of the most trivial social affair. What had he done
that this measure should be constantly graduated out
to him? Well, things would be different. He would
"can" personality and take up the "big mitt" of
public things. But how was this revolution in the
private disposition of a man to be accomplished? He
had discovered the result, but not the cause; so he
began rooting among the sage brush of the sand downs
for the foundation stone of his social submergence.</p>

<p>"I have it!" he shouted one day. "If one wishes
to make a puncture in the affairs of this world
one must assert himself; one must smite the table top
with one's fist every morning before breakfast. One
must assume such an atmosphere that the whole com<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span></a>munity
will be cognizant of one's presence, to-day,
to-morrow, and all the time. One must assert one's
personality. I have been asleep, stagnant, dormant,
an Egyptian mummy. I have allowed others to take
the cream while I have been passively contented with
the whey. I have allowed others to elbow me to one
side like a log languishing in the eddy of a river.
Henceforth I will be in the centre of the stream. I
will rush down with the torrent and be "It" in the
Ashcroft "smart set" illumination.</p>

<p>"There will be no public works in future that does
not bear my signature. In a word, I will assert myself,
lock, stock and barrel."</p>

<p>So he hit out upon a new highway with the determination
to be popular. He neglected his own stamp-mill
that the work might be carried out to a successful
issue. He engaged others to take charge of the
tail race and dump, with which he would not trust his
brother on previous occasions. In fact, he left the
steam of the mill at high pressure to look after itself
that he might have an unhampered course in the
asserting of himself. He invaded immediately all the
dances, carnivals, dinners and parties. He was both
Liberal and Conservative in politics. He was the
"guy" with the "big mitt" and the vociferous
vocabulary at all the local functions. He even joined
the church. He tumbled into popularity as quickly
as the Kaiser tumbled into the European war; and he
elbowed his way into the run-way for all offices. Previously
bright stars were dimmed by the brilliancy
of his superior luminosity. He became a parasite at
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span></a>the local stores and clubs, and was a wart on the
grocer's counter. He became a whirlwind of popularity.
He was as much in the advance as he had
before been in the rear, and, if there was any German
trench to take, he was always first to jump into it.
He had the big voice in every local eruption. Every
time he batted he made a home run. He even made
initiative suggestions for schemes which were more
or less amalgamated with reason and insanity. It is
said that he was first at the dances, and first in the
hearts of the ladies. It is certain he was the first to
invent the sewerage system idea; and the patents
were applied for before the final endorsements had
been secured.</p>

<p>"I will make the man swallow his words who
awarded me that booby prize," he thundered; and he
was going the right way about it. He imposed his
individuality with emphasis. He was taken by the
hand and dragged along cheerfully. He found himself
coveted and envied now, where, before, he had
almost been denied citizenship. He was now a qualified
voter, where, before, he had been disfranchised.
He found himself in the front ranks of all social movements,
for he had asserted himself with an accent.
It was a case of applied personality with him, and it
was developing just as he had anticipated. Of course
it was a superficial personality; it had no intrinsic
value, but it answered the purpose. He received
many important appointments. He was created
secretary to the School Board, secretary to the
Ashcroft Rinks, secretary to the Hospital, sec<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span></a>retary
to the Ashcroft Hockey boys, secretary
to the Ladies' Knitting Guild, secretary to the
Ladies' Auxiliary. In fact, he was unanimously
chosen an official in all the local public works
which had no salary attached to them. But
then, he was gaining in popularity, and what did it
matter if his office was filled to overflowing with
exotic paraphernalia, he was reaching that apex to
which he had aspired, and the emolument was a mere
bagatelle. The booby prize, after all, had been the
foundation of his success.</p>

<p>So things went on and he became the most talked of
man in the town. When any difficulty arose he was
the first to be consulted. The town found it necessary
to come to him for information on every local scheme
that had its birth in the local cerebrum, for no one
else was capable of handling any emergency and carrying
it through to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>Just about this time the sewerage epidemic took
possession of the town, and became an insane contagion.
Meetings were held at various places to discuss
the matter, and at last the government agent
allowed the court house to be used gratis for that
purpose. Of course our hero and two other victims
were appointed commissioners to investigate. His
salary was the same as he received from his various
secretaryships.</p>

<p>It was proposed to mortgage the town for forty
years to the provincial government for its endorsement
to local bonds, and the commissioners were empowered
to have the alleys and necessary places sur<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]</span></a>veyed
with a view to ascertaining the magnitude of
the undertaking, and the amount of the collateral
which it would be necessary to raise in England, upon
the endorsed bonds, to push the work through to a
successful conclusion. The victims set to work with
full knowledge of the stupendous responsibility which
had been slung, yoke-like, across their shoulders. Surveyors
were engaged, and an expert calculator was
summoned to give an estimate of the cost of such an
undertaking. The estimate was placed at $75,000.00.
This enlightenment gave the community a volcanic
eruption; an epidemic of "cold feet" took possession
of them, and they retired to warm these extremities
at their respective air-tight heaters. In
the meantime the commissioners had guaranteed
payment to the experts whom they had engaged, and
their personal notes were urgently requested. The
expenses which they had incurred amounted to about
five hundred dollars. When the vouchers were
hawked about town for endorsements they received
the "high ball," and the victims found it necessary
to "make good" from their personal rainy day
deposits. The unpopular man took a sly glance back
at the ancient happy hunting-grounds antedating his
booby prize days.</p>

<p>It was just about this time that an agent of the
Independent Trust Company drifted into town "incidentally,"
and became acquainted with the boys. He
made it known in a sort of casual way that he was
disposing of shares in the said company, which were
valued at more than they were worth&mdash;that is, were
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span></a>worth more than their valuation. To keep up the
"bluff" the unpopular man bought a thousand
"plunks" worth of shares.</p>

<p>"Now," said the shark, "since you have shown so
much confidence in my company by purchasing shares,
you can prove your patriotism more fully by placing
a substantial deposit with the Independent Trust.
This will help maintain the company on solid footing,
and ensure you higher dividends on your stock.
I will give you my personal guarantee that your
money will be safer, and more productive than it
would be in the Bank."</p>

<p>The "boob" seized the bait like a trout in the
Bonaparte, and made a deposit of five thousand dollars.
Shortly afterwards the company went into
liquidation, and his six thousand dollars sailed away
with the worthless liquid into the sea of oblivion.</p>

<p>About this same time, when his popularity was at
its zenith, and was rivalling that of Dr. Cook, the fake
discoverer of the North Pole, another shark came
down with the rain selling the most marvellous
money-making scheme ever offered to the public of
British Columbia. This was X.Y.Z. Fire Insurance
shares, which he was disposing of at a great
sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Let me sell you some shares in the only 'real
thing' that has been offered to the public since the
flood," he tempted.</p>

<p>The victim was so much under the shark's influence
that he was hypnotized.</p><p><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span></a></p>

<p>"Certainly," he said. "Write me down for five
hundred 'doughbaby's' worth."</p>

<p>"You mean a thousand," said the shark.</p>

<p>"No," said the "gink," timidly, "I have only five
hundred in my sock; that will be as much as my pack
will carry."</p>

<p>"Exactly; that is just right. You see, you are
buying a thousand dollars worth of goods with only
five hundred dollars worth of cash. The shares are
fifty dollars each, with a cash payment of twenty-five
dollars, and the balance subject to call. This balance
will never be called for, because on no occasion has
an insurance company been known to call in its
balance of subscribed stock; and the X.Y.Z. is not
going to establish a precedent in this respect.
You will have twenty shares for five hundred dollars.
In other words, you will draw interest on one thousand
dollars, and only have five hundred invested.
Was ever a business so philanthropic in its foundation?"</p>

<p>Our hero grabbed the bait like a pure-bred sucker,
and handed out his last asset.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the company was in the hands of
receivers with all its assets vaporized. The popular
man found himself on the "rocks." Being
popular for a short time had proved a
very expensive expedition for him. The retreat
rivalled that of the Kaiser's retreat from
Paris. It was so sudden that the town heard the thud
and felt the jar. The unpopular man realized that it
is wiser to remain in one's natural element even if it is
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span></a>necessary to sacrifice many of the first prizes. Perhaps
it is better to go after the prizes for which we
are qualified, than to aspire to elevations which we
are unable to hold intelligently.</p>

<p>The unpopular man backed himself up into his
burrow, and for a time the silence around town was
embarrassing.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_Hard_Times_Hance" id="Of_Hard_Times_Hance"></a>Of Hard Times Hance</h2>


<p>Once upon a time on the foothills in the environs
of Clinton, Lillooet District, Province of British
Columbia, there lived a "mossback" who was as
happy as the 22nd day of June is long in each year.
At initiative conclusions he would be classified with
the freak species of humanity, but beneath his raw exterior
there lurked rich mines which the moss kept a
secret from the inquisitive, avaricious world.</p>

<p>He owned and operated an extensive ranch from
which he encouraged enough vegetation to feed himself,
his pigs, his horses, his cattle, his chickens,
and his dog; and this, apparently, was all
they derived from the great, green earth. But
the asset side of our "mossback's" yearly
balance sheet always made the liability side
ashamed of itself. The asset increased annually,
and the hidden treasure grew to alarming proportions.
This growth was carefully salted away at the
appropriate salting-down season, when the pork barrels
were brought out of the dark cellars, dusted,
scrubbed, and refilled with the carcasses of those
animals which had been his companions for the
greater part of a year. He was a standing joke with
the "hands" on the ranch, for he was the most
dilapidated of the whole gang, although the owner,
and was reputed to be wealthy.</p><p><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span></a></p>

<p>But he was a man with a purpose in life, and that
was more than a great many could say. He was
chronically eccentric. When he first located on the
homestead which had since become so valuable an
asset, he had determined to live with one purpose in
view, and that was to expand financially with the toil
of his hands and the sweat of his brow, and then, when
he had acquired sufficient sinking fund, to emerge
suddenly into the limelight of society and shine like
a newly polished gem. So he wandered up and down
the trail which his own feet and the feet of his cayuse
had worn through the woods, up the creek, along the
face of the mountains, and away down to the limy
waters of the Fraser on the other side of the perpetual
snows.</p>

<p>There was a fascination for him on this old trail;
it had become as part of his life, of his very soul.
Sometimes he would be rounding up cattle. Sometimes
he would be hunting mowich (deer), or driving
off the coyotes. All his plans and schemes were
built on trail foundation. He could not think unless
he was tramping the trail through the woods, and
down the valleys. Here is where all his castles were
constructed; and, from the trail observatory, he saw
his new life spring into being, when the time would
be ripe.</p>

<p>In time the coin grew so bulky that it became a
burden to him. It had grown very cumbersome. He
might at any time resurrect himself into that new
world of his, but there was no occasion for haste; he
was very happy and contented; besides, it would mean
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span></a>leaving the old trail and things. He had his balance
banked in a strong box which he buried in a hole
under his bed, and the fear grew upon him that some
mercenary might discover its lurking-place and relieve
him of the burden of responsibility. This was
the only skeleton which lurked in the man's closet.
It was the only cloud in his sky; the rest of the zenith
was sunshine and gladness. To the neighbors and
itineraries he had been preaching hard times for
twenty years, although the whole earth suspected the
contrary. He became known throughout the width
and breadth of Yale, Lillooet and Cariboo as "Hard
Times Hance." Although diplomatically reserved and
unsociable, he was more popular and famed than he
suspected. Peculiarity is a valuable advertisement.</p>

<p>His outward appearance and mode of life certainly
justified the above appendix to his personality, and
it was so blazoned that it could be seen and heard all
over British Columbia. He had but one competitor,
and that was "Dirty Harry," who at one time frequented
the streets of Ashcroft. No other name
could have distinguished him so completely from the
other members of the human family.</p>

<p>His overalls, which were once blue, had become
pale with age, and had adopted a dishrag-white color;
and one of the original legs had been patched out of
existence. His Stetson hat, which had left the factory
a deep brown, now approached the color of his
terrestrial real estate. His "jumper" had lost its
blue and white "jail bird" stripe effect, and was now
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span></a>a cross between a faded Brussels carpet and a grain
sack. To save buying boots he wore his last winter's
overshoes away into the summer, while his feet would
blister in discomfort. Braces were a luxury which
he could not endure, so he supported his superfluously
laundried overalls with a strand of baling-rope which
had already served its time as a halter guy. His feet
had never known the luxury of a factory or home-knitted
stocking since he had graduated from the
home crib, but were put off with gunny sacking which
had already seen active service as nose bags for the
cayuses.</p>

<p>"If one wishes to acquire wealth in this world,"
he would say, "one must make a great many personal
sacrifices." So he lived on and waxed wealthy
at the expense even of the simplest of domestic comforts.</p>

<p>The improvements with which he had enhanced the
value of his ranch were much in keeping with his
personal appearance, and they could be recognized as
brothers with the least difficulty. The fences, which
had refused to retain their youth against the passing
years, had their aged and feeble limbs supported with
thongs and makeshifts of every description; and where
their pride had rebelled against such ingratitude, they
were smothered beneath the limbs of fallen trees, which
had been felled on the spot to serve as substitutes.
His flumes were knock-kneed and bow-legged, and in
places they had no legs at all. Their sides were warped
and bulged with the alternate damp and drouth, heat
and cold. The lumber was bleached white, and por<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span></a>ous
with decay. It was with difficulty they could be
persuaded to remain at their water-carrying capacity.
The ditches were choked with willows and maples to
such an extent that they were abandoned only in
spots where they asserted themselves, and refused to
convey the necessary irrigation stream. Here they
would burst their sides with indignation, and had to
be repaired. The barns, stables and chicken-houses
had for years been threatening to collapse unless supplied
with some stimulant; so numerous false-works
had been erected, outside and in, to retain them within
their confines. The harness, which had originally
been made of leather, betrayed very little trace of
this bovine enveloper, but was composed chiefly of
baling-rope and wire which had been picked up at
random on the ranch as the occasion demanded. The
various sections of the wheels of his wagons remained
in intimate association with each other because
they were submerged in the creek every night;
the moisture keeping the wood swelled to its greatest
diameter. One day's exposure to the drouth, without
the convenient assistance of the creek water, would
have been sufficient to cause the wheels to fall asunder.
In this respect the unsuspecting creek was an asset
of incalculable value. The boxes of his wagons could
boast of nothing up to date, that was not possessed
by the wheels; and in many cases the tongues and
whiffletrees and neck-yokes had been substituted by
raw maples or birch secured on the ranch. His unwritten
law was to buy nothing that would cost
money, and to import nothing that could be pro<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]</span></a>duced
on the farm even if it was only a poor makeshift
substitute. No part was ever replaced until it
had gone hopelessly on strike, and necessity was his
only motive power when it came to repairs. The
general conditions were suggestive of the obsolete.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this ruin and decay, however,
there was sunshine, and the heart of Hard Times
Hance was warm and buoyant, cheerful and hopeful,
and even if he did live upon the husks which
the swine did eat, he derived from his life a great
deal more pleasure than the world gave him credit
for. He had his future to live for. He had his life
all mapped out, and that was more than a great
many could boast of. For breakfast he had mush,
for dinner he had beans and bacon, and for supper
he had bacon and beans and Y.S. tea. And he was
just as happy eating this fare with his knife as the
Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of British
Columbia could be with his cereal, consomme, lobster
salad, charlotte russe, blanc mange, caf&eacute; noir, or any
other dainty and delicate importation. Bananas,
oranges and artichokes had no place on his bill-of-fare.
Besides, after he had eaten a meal he had no
space for such delicacies. And he could always wash
his meal down with the famous Y.S. tea stand-by;
and, on top of this, a few long draws at his kin-i-kin-nick
(sort of Indian tobacco) pipe. And then there
were no restrictions upon his mode of feeding his
face. He could eat with his knife with impunity.
There was no etiquette-mad society digging him in
the ribs, and jerking on the reins in protestation at
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span></a>every one of his natural inclinations; and he could
use his own knife to butter his sourdough bread.
For a man who expected to emerge into the sunshine
of society, he was giving himself very inadequate
training. He was as near the aboriginal as it was
possible for a white man to approach. He was a
Siwash (male Indian) with one exception&mdash;his
love of the coin. But then, he had an object in
this ambition; and a fault, if it is a means to a worthy
end, must be commended. He had this propensity
developed to the most pronounced degree. It was
a disease with him, for which there was no cure. In
outward appearance he was a typical B.C. specimen
of the obsolete "coureur de bois" of eastern Canada
during the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The interior of his "dug-out" was more like an
Indian kik-willy (ancient Indian house) than the
dwelling of a modern Anglo-Saxon. The walls were
composed of the rough timbers, and the chinks were
stuffed with rags and old newspapers. A few smoke-begrimed
pictures were hanging on the walls, and a
calendar of the year 1881 still glared forth in all its
ancient uselessness, leading one back into a past
decade. If he broke the rules of etiquette by eating
with his knife, he also smashed those of modesty by
utilizing his air-tight heater as a cuspidor, for it was
streaked white with evaporated saliva.</p>

<p>How this crude bud ever anticipated blooming out
into a society blossom was a conundrum. Perhaps
he had some secret method buried in the same box
with his hoarded coin. His long evenings were
passed reading the <i>Family Herald and Weekly Star</i>
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]</span></a>and the <i>Ashcroft Journal</i> by candle-light; for those
were the only papers he would subscribe for. His
bed consisted of, first, boards, then straw, then sacking;
and it had remained so long without being
frayed out that it had become packed as hard as
terra firma. His blankets had not seen the light of
day, nor enjoyed the fresh cool breezes for many long
years. His one window was opaque with the smoke
of many years' accumulation. Although his chickens
had a coop of their own where they roosted at night,
they ran about the floor of his "dug-out" in the daytime
looking for crumbs that fell from the poor man's
table; and his cat, through years of criminal impunity,
would sit on the table at mealtime and help
himself to the victuals just as the spirit moved him.
A stump had been left standing when the cabin was
built; it had been hewn at the appropriate elevation
of a chair. This was near his air-tight heater, and
his favorite position was to sit there with his feet
propped against the stove and smoke by candle-light;
and sometimes he would sit in the dark to save
candles. His other furniture consisted of "Reindeer"
brand condensed milk and blue-mottled soap
boxes, which he had acquired at times from F.W.
Foster's general store at Clinton.</p>

<p>Hard Times Hance was living on first principles;
but then, if a man wishes to save any coin in this
world he must make great personal sacrifices; and
so he was perfectly happy in his temporary aboriginal
condition. There were no restrictions upon him.
He was even outside the circumference of any min<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]</span></a>isterial
jurisdiction, and had never been cautioned
about the hereafter. Like an Indian, he moved just
as the impulse seized him. How this man expected
to submit to the personal restrictions and embargoes
imposed by modern fashions and society was known
only to himself. The song of the forest had been his
only concert; the whisper of the creek his sole heart
companion. When occasion permitted he would
wander the entire day on the high mountains, at the
end of his trail, hunting for game, and little caring
whether he found it or not, so long as he had the wild
and congenial environs to admire and embrace. What
was city life in comparison with this?</p>

<p>At last the day arrived when he realized that he
must develop wings, so he wrapped himself up in a
cocoon; and while the metamorphosis was in process
of development he had ample time to study Hamlet's
soliloquy. It would mean a divorce from everything
he held dear; a parting with his very soul. It would
mean the most sorrowful widowhood that could be
imposed on man. It would be equivalent to leaving
this earth and taking up his abode in Mars. He
must sacrifice his love for the creek and the trail. He
must renounce his freedom and go into social slavery.
It was the emerging from the woods into the prairie;
the coming from darkness into the light; a resurrection
from the dead. In future he must tread the
smooth cement walk between cultivated lawns and
plants, instead of climbing the rude, uneven trail
obstructed by fallen trees and surrounded with vegetation
in its wildest and most primeval forms. He
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]</span></a>would walk the polished mahogany floor with patent
boots, instead of the terrestrial one of his dug-out with
obsolete overshoes.</p>

<p>But it must be. For years he had been preparing
and planning. The object of his past had been a
preparation for a better future; and why not? Others
enjoyed the good things of this life, and why not he?
Had he not paid the price. Others reaped where
they had not sown; he had sown, yes, sown in persecution,
now he would reap in envious joy. He had
lived the first half of his life in squalor and darkness,
that the latter half might be clean and cheerful.
When he had set out in his young days to live his
pre-arranged history it was with an ambition to be
wealthy, no matter by what means it should be acquired,
so long as it was honest. Now he was wealthy.
He had been poor; now he was rich, and money
would put the world at his feet, which henceforth
had been over his head. He had been an animal;
from now on he would be human.</p>

<p>But in his enthusiasm of development he forgot
that he had grown attached to the wild, aboriginal
life; that the parting might snap thongs and inflict
wounds which even time would not mend or
cure. At times the creek would sing, and the trail
would speak, but he banished the tempters from his
mind to make room for his illuminating prospects,
and his wings continued to grow towards maturity.
He struggled and freed himself from the cocoon. He
went to Vancouver a caterpillar and returned a
butterfly, and the earthquake which accompanied his
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]</span></a>debut was equal to that which destroyed San Francisco.
He had sold his farm, which included the
creek, and the trail, and the dug-out, and his salt pork
barrel, for a song, and with his coin and icties about
him, and in his lately acquired form, he invaded
Clinton with an accentuated front. The street was
lined with people as though a procession had been
going by&mdash;all the sweet and familiar sounds and
sights had been sacrificed criminally, and he was on
his way to sip honey from flower to flower.</p>

<p>He sounded about Clinton for some time for a
suitable anchorage on which to materialize the plans
and specifications of his mansion, but he did not
drive a stake, because Clinton was very much inferior
to his "class" ideal; it had no electric light,
and no water system. So he migrated south to Ashcroft,
and there he pre-empted a large lot and made
arrangements for the foundation of his castle. Out
of the ground in a short period arose one of the most
up-to-date bungalows. While the building was in
course of construction Hard Times Hance, who had
repudiated this headline, moved about in his dress
suit, stiff hat, silk gloves, and a cane, and gave such
orders to the contractor as he saw fit. He was looked
upon as the most remarkable freak that had ever invaded
the dry belt. And he sprang into society
spontaneously. The people clamored for him. Progressive
socials were arranged in his honor at all the
leading social centres in their eagerness to cultivate
his society. Some had faint recollections of having
seen him at times, others claimed to have heard of
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 46]</span></a>him at his hermitage, but they all pretended to have
known him personally and thoroughly, and many even
suspected that he possessed more, intrinsically, than
he had revealed superficially. He was the lion of the
hour, and he did not forget to hand around the coin
in his efforts to retain the position which he had
secured.</p>

<p>When his mansion was turned over by the contractor,
and had been accepted by the architect, he
issued invitations to one of the most magnificent
social functions which had ever erupted at Ashcroft.
Those who were invited were flattered, and those who
were not called were grossly insulted and wondered
what disqualified them. They danced the "tango,"
and the "bango," and the "flango," and all the
"light fantastics" until their feet went on strike,
and their ear drums had become phonographic and
reproduced the music with a perpetual motion which
could not be stopped. Every lady was eager to reveal
the dancing secrets to mine host, and before the evening
was over he could waltz, tango, and do many of
the up-to-date ridiculous "stunts."</p>

<p>And then they dined on a French dinner. It was
cooked in French style, and they ate it in French;
and then they drank French toasts to the King of
England, the Governor-General of Canada, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, and the gentlemen drank to the ladies
in general all over the world. Then the ladies proposed
a French toast to "mine host." Not one of
them could speak French, although a few of them
could repeat, parrot-like, the words "Parlez-vous
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 47]</span></a>Francais?" but they only knew it as a "foreign
phrase" which sounded extremely cultured.</p>

<p>And the menu was as follows: "Canape of Anchovies,"
"Celery en Branch," "Potage a la Reine,"
"Consomme au Celeri," "Calves' Sweetbreads a la
Rothschilds," "French Lamb Chops a la Nelson,"
"Caf&eacute; noir," etc., etc.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this foreign celestialism mine
host forgot the creek, the trail, the dug-out, the beans
and bacon, and the kin-i-kin-nick pipe; and he prided
himself on his rapid and agreeable transition into
swift channels of life. He was taking to society as
a duck takes to water.</p>

<p>In mode of living, as well as in personal appearance,
it was the greatest metamorphosis that had ever
taken place in a human being in the memory of man.
It was a miniature "Log Cabin to White House"
episode. He furnished his castle with the most
elaborate fittings and ornaments that the world could
produce. He had steam heated rooms and electric
lighting from cellar to attic. Every floor was carpeted
with the most expensive of imported Brussels.
The walls were most elaborately painted and decorated.
To secure a final footing in society he had
acquired a collection of obsolete paintings, which
were very unattractive and vulgar, and could only
have been of value as heirlooms to some private
family. These were conspicuously displayed on the
panelled walls, in partnership with other more or
less modest busts and imaginary landscapes. His
ceilings were frescoed and figured in most extrava<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]</span></a>gant,
but unappealing designs. It was plainly seen
that the building had been erected more to satisfy
the taste and please the eye of the architect, who
had received an unrestricted contract, than for acceptance
by the purchaser. The furnishings were very
much in keeping with the fixtures and fittings, and
his musical instruments were all electrically-automatic
machines; and his "canned" music filled the
halls and stairways from morning till night. There
was no modern convenience or indulgence that he did
not lasso and drag home to his castle.</p>

<p>Before, he had wallowed in the one extreme of
society, but now he lolled at the other. While before
he had been neglected and despised by his fellow
rivals, he was now courted, and admired, and feasted
almost to death: so much does the possession of the
coin-asset change people's opinions with regard to
others.</p>

<p>His auto was the envy of all the chauffeurs and
private car owners in the interior, and there was
great rivalry among the licensed drivers as to who
should secure the position as his private chauffeur.
One engineer offered his services gratis to have the
privilege of sitting behind such wind-shields.</p>

<p>Hard Times Hance persuaded himself that he had
reached his "Utopia," and that his past forty years
of loneliness and savagery was the price he had paid
for the present heaven-rivalling blessings.</p>

<p>A man of his standing in society could not long
remain in single dormancy; he was therefore besieged
by many of the fair sex. This was very pleasing and
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]</span></a>flattering to him, although he concealed his appreciation.
Of course a palace such as his, without a
wife, was like a garden of Eden without an Eve.
He had no one to use the electric vacuum cleaner on
his linoleums and tapestries. He had no one to meet
him when he reached home to take his hat, and gloves,
and cane, and place them on the hall rack. He had
no one to kiss and afford companionship throughout
the long evenings, no one to arrange for social entertainments
and meet and welcome the guests; no one
to direct and manage the culinary department, and
place the furniture in appetizing arrangement. Of
course he had the Chinese cook, but he was stale and
without spice. There were millions of qualified candidates
in the world, looking for partners, who
would be more than pleased to have the opportunity
to manipulate his vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>No sooner had he made up his mind to organize a
family partnership concern than he set out to have
the necessary forms of contract drafted and prepared.
A great many fair ones nominated themselves as candidates
for election, but as he was living under Christian
methods he could only accept one&mdash;which was
annoying&mdash;no matter how eager he may have been to
Mormonize himself. They fluttered around him like
moths about an electric arc, and they even deserted
their former pre-emptions for the new float prospects.
In due course the successful candidate was introduced
to the Legislature as a new member.</p>

<p>The nuptials over, they migrated in the fall with
the swallows to California, on their honeymoon, and,
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]</span></a>after escaping the earthquake, returned to their happy
and beautiful home. There was a great eruption
among the marriageable prospects of Ashcroft, because
many of them had dropped a real bone into the
water in snapping at the illusory shadow.</p>

<p>An indignation meeting was arranged at which it
was resolved that the least prepossessing and most
unlikely of the nominees had secured the winning
majority. But love is a very contrary commodity,
and a defect may be a virtue in the eyes of a hero-worshipper;
and "My Lady" was serenely happy in
spite of her unpopularity with her rivals. Hard
Times Hance had sprouted from pauperdom and had
bloomed into princedom, and his newly acquired
partner placed the final mouldings and decorations
to his life.</p>

<p>They gave frequent balls and banquets, and the
most select society in the environs clamored for admittance.
To his wife the prince was a modern
Aladdin. She had but to wish and the wish was
granted. "Eaton's" catalogue was her Bible, and
it was her only food between meals; packages
arrived daily with the regularity of the <i>Vancouver
Province</i>. She had a standing order there for hats,
dresses and kimonas, to be rushed out the moment the
fashions changed. While before Hance had taken a
pleasure in saving, he now had a mania for spending
money; and their merry marriage bells continued to
ring for a few sweet years without ceasing.</p>

<p>But gradually the spell wore off the self-made
prince. The little creek, the long trail, the deep
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]</span></a>woods, the dug-out, and the salt pork barrel loomed up
occasionally before his mind's eye. In absent-minded
dreams he would find himself wandering among the
stock on the range at his old ranch; or he would
be drinking water from the creek in the old-fashioned,
natural way; or chasing a deer at the other end of the
long trail. His wife's sweet voice would recall him
to the immediate, and in her presence he would regret
his meditations. But it would be but temporary.
What profits a man to gain the world, if he lose his
peace of mind? "What! I unhappy among all this
kingly paraphernalia, and with a queen wife?" he
would ask himself, going down into the basement to
replenish the furnace. With every shovelful of coal
he would curse himself for his feebleness of mind.</p>

<p>The charm was beginning to wear off. The sound
of the singing creek and the wild wood noises were
beginning to knock at his door. He was beginning to
long for the old, wild life&mdash;the life of the wild man
of the woods. He was like a coyote in confinement,
walking backward and forward at the bars seeking
release. He was a fish out of water gasping for its
natural element, and his soul was languishing within
him.</p>

<p>He made desperate but vain efforts to enjoy his
beautiful environs, and for a long time he sustained
the "bluff." The piano became a bore to him; its
music was not half so sweet as the creek song. The
tapestry was not half so pleasing to the eye as the
green foliage of the trees had been; his cement walk
not so agreeable to his feet as had been the long, wild
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]</span></a>trail. The "icties" which had cost him thousands
of dollars became to him like so much junk, and his
beautiful home became a prison&mdash;so much does man
become attached to mother earth. Among all this
junk one jewel still continued persistently to shine,
however, and that gem was his wife; she was all he
had left, next his heart, to balance against the thousands
of dollars which he had squandered. A man's
best comfort is his wife, and Hance had fallen into
the trap in the usual man-like way.</p>

<p>His attraction for the modern in society had
dwindled down to a single item&mdash;his love for his
wife; and between this fire, and the fire of the old
life, he remained poised. Of course it would be
madness to suggest that she return with him to the
woods and adopt the Adam and Eve mode of society,
so he kept his skeleton securely locked up.</p>

<p>He had sold his farm for a song, but now he found
it could not be re-bought for real money. The situation
was hopeless. There was no retracing of steps.
But still the old sounds could not be divorced from
his ears; and the old salt-pork barrel was an unpardonable
culprit. If he could only sit once again
on the old stump which had not been hewn away in
the centre of his dug-out, it would be a source of joy
to him. If he could only smoke the old kin-i-kin-nick
pipe, his appetite would be satisfied.</p>

<p>One day he climbed into his auto and made a bee-line
for the old ranch. He would have a rock on
that old stump if it should cause a scandal in
society. But the spot where the dug-out once
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]</span></a>stood was now bare. The cabin had been burned to
the ground by the new proprietors. He went home
like a whipped cur. A link in his beautiful past had
vanished. An impassable chasm, of his own making,
yawned between him and his desire, and he cursed
the day which lured him away from his natural, green
pastures.</p>

<p>One day he disappeared entirely, and when he did
not return for several days, and his wife was insane
with grief, a search party was sent out in quest of
him. They found him camping on the old trail,
dressed in his aboriginal attire, eating beans and
bacon with his knife, and chewing venison Indian
fashion.</p>

<p>"This is the only square meal I have had since I
left the woods," he said, when they captured him;
and he filled his pipe with kin-i-kin-nick and puffed
the sweet, mild fumes. He had returned to his
natural element.</p>

<p>"I have been rounding up stock," he said, "and I
shot this buck just over the hill there. Here, dig in,
it is jake."</p>

<p>He had to live among the steers, and the coyotes,
and the wild trails in accordance with his early training;
original things were his food. Society, and his
wife, demanded that he remain on the surface, but
his aboriginal inclinations lured him to the woods;
so, during six months of every year he was an Indian
to all intents and purposes. Early in May he would
load a cayuse with beans, bacon, canned milk, frying
pan and blankets, and with this treasure he would
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]</span></a>take to the hills and bask the livelong summer among
the junipers, the firs, and the spruces; and he would
eat huckleberries, choke-cherries and soap-o-lalies,
and smoke kin-i-kin-nick until his complexion
assumed the tan of the Chilcoten Indian.</p>

<p>The lure of the limelight had been great, but it
had worn off just as soon as he had a surfeit of its
false glories. He found that beans and bacon eaten
with a knife were sweeter and more wholesome than
"blanc mange," "consomme," or "caf&eacute; noir" cooked
in French style, and served by a French chef.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Too_Sure_Man" id="Of_the_Too_Sure_Man"></a>Of the Too Sure Man</h2>


<p>Once upon a time, in the town of Lillooet, county
of Lillooet, Province of British Columbia, there lived
a man who was so sure of his footing that he closed
his eyes and floundered along in the dark. When
people told him there were chasms in front of him,
or that there was ice on the trail ahead, he would not
believe them, but put his fingers in his ears so that
he could not hear, and thus became deaf and blind to
his own interests. The people pestered him so much
about his folly, and he learned to hate them so much
for their interference in his personal matters, that
he crossed the names of all his friends from his list of
social possibilities, would recognize none of them,
and refused to speak even when addressed; he thus
became a blind, deaf and dumb mute. The result
was that he ultimately slipped upon the ice on the
trail, and fell into a chasm and has not been seen
since. It was in the first days of the Lillooet quartz
discoveries. Gold had been mined from Cayuse
Creek, Bridge River, and the Fraser River, in uncountable
ounces, in the free state, by the placer or
hydraulic process of mining, for a great number of
years, but the source of supply from which the free
gold had originated had not yet been located. It
was even doubted if there was any source of supply,
although it was generally conceded that all gold was
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]</span></a>originally pilfered by the streams and rivers from the
hard quartz-rocks of which the great mountains of
Cayuse Creek and Bridge River were formed. While
some of the miners contented themselves with making
wing-dams, turning streams from their natural
courses, and scraping about the mud and gravel of
the exposed beds for the pure, free gold, picking up
nuggets at sight and capturing the "dust" with quicksilver,
others, looking for bigger game, climbed the
high mountains, tore the moss from their sides to
expose the rock, and pounced upon every piece of
"float" which would indicate the possible existence
of a "mother lode" somewhere near at hand or
higher up.</p>

<p>The Too Sure Man of this story was one of the
latter. He had found a piece of "float rock" with a
shining speck in it near where the nigger's cabin
now stands on Cayuse Creek in the vicinity of
Lillooet, and he traced it to the very spot where it
had dropped from the mountain above. There he
discovered a ledge several feet wide full of shining
specks, and he traced it with his eyes right to the bed
of the creek.</p>

<p>"All mine! All mine!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Now, he was a poor man, and he had a family&mdash;which
made him poorer; but the sight of this precious
piece of "float" with the gold sticking out of it, and
the possession of this enormous ledge of gold-bearing
quartz made him a millionaire in an instant. Here
was a whole mountain "lousy" with gold, all his!
Why, Solomon or Vanderbilt would be so small in
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]</span></a>the puddle that he would splash mud on them with his
superior tread in the sweet "very soon."</p>

<p>Now, the B.C. law prevented him from staking off
the entire Lillooet district for himself, so he took in
a friend (who luckily died before the crash came),
and they appropriated as large a portion each of the
district as the Government at that time would allow.
Both of those men had good, steady, paying jobs at
the time of the discovery, but the next day they threw
down their tools&mdash;work was too cheap for them. The
only thing that prevented them from buying an automobile
right away on the instalment plan was the fact
that the auto had not yet been invented. However,
they had to do something to elevate themselves from
the common, so they became extravagant in their
domestic curriculum. Having no money, the stores
had to "carry them." And then they had their assessment
work to do on the mine to enable them to hold
the claim. They hired men to do this and gave them
promissory notes payable by the claim at an indefinite
period. When a man ceases work and begins
to live on his "rainy day" money, or on the storekeeper,
it does not take very long before he accumulates
a burden greater than he can carry. When he
begins to totter he tries to pass some of the load over
to others, and it is usually the storekeepers who are
willing to assist him to the limit if his assets are in
good retrospect. And what could be a greater security
than a whole mountain full of gold? So the storekeepers
assumed a large portion of the Too Sure
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]</span></a>Man's burden. And their loads became heavier and
heavier. One day a company came along, attracted
by the noise that had been made, and bonded the
claims for a few hundred "plunks" down and the balance
of one hundred thousand dollars in three months
if they decided to take the claims over. The offer was
gladly accepted, although they wondered why the company
hesitated. This few hundred dollars enabled
the Too Sure Man to tide his family through the
winter with warm and expensive clothing from the
T. Eaton Co., of Toronto, Ontario, while the local
grocery man's burden got heavier and heavier. It
was during, all this time that the people had been
cautioning him for his personal benefit. And it was
during this time that the Too Sure Man closed his
ears, and his eyes, and his mouth, and became a blind,
deaf and dumb mute. When the three months were
up the company decamped, forfeiting their few hundred
dollars, and then there was "something doing."
The Too Sure Man opened his eyes and his ears and
his mouth all at the same time as far as ever he could.
The claim had proved a failure, there was no gold,
and only a slight trace on the surface. The local
storekeepers, groaning under their load, asked him to
relieve them, but he might just as well have tried to
lift the mountain that held his worthless quartz ledge.
It was just at this point of our story that he slipped
on the ice and fell into the chasm. He disappeared,
bag, baggage, and family; and in truth it was the
only course open to him.</p><p><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 59]</span></a></p>

<p>To remain and work off his debt and sustain his
family at the same time with the increasing pressure
of the high cost of living holding him under, would
have been an utter impossibility. The impending
shock killed his partner, for he died before the crash
came. The Too Sure Man has a burden in Lillooet
supported by others which he can come and lift at
any time, and welcome.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Unloved_Man" id="Of_the_Unloved_Man"></a>Of the Unloved Man</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in Ashcroft a bachelor fellow
realized abruptly that he had never been loved by one
of the opposite sex, although he had reached the age
of two score and two, and had a great longing to have
one included in his assessable personal property.
Now, as truth is stranger than fiction, the discovery
staggered him. What was wrong? What machinery
required adjusting? He had the sensation of a boycotted
egg, and was in danger of spoiling before reaching
the consuming market. So one day he perched
himself on the sandhill and began to survey the
environs for a solution to the problem. Why should
he be denied this one sweet dream? Just think of it&mdash;no
one had ever sympathized with him in his utter
loneliness of bachelorhood. No girl had ever called
him her "snooky ookums," and he had never had the
opportunity of calling any fair vision his "tootsy
wootsy." The horror of the situation was sufficient
to stagger an empire. No girl had ever waited at the
post-office corner for him. No girl had ever tapped on
his office window on Railway Avenue and smiled
back at him on her way home from the meat market.
No girl had ever lingered outside for him that she
might have the pleasure of his society home to lunch.
He had to walk the bridge evenings and Sundays
alone, while others went in limited liability companies.</p><p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]</span></a></p>

<p>Once, when he was ill, no angel had volunteered to
smooth his pillow, and a Chinaman brought up delicacies
left over from some other person's previous
meal. He had no silent partner. None of the girls
knew he had been ailing, and when he told them weeks
after they feigned surprise. There seemed to be an
unsurmountable stone wall between him and the sweet
things of this world. So, day after day, in his leisure
moments, he would pace the brow of the sandhill
seeking in his mind for a solution to an issue that
seemed unfathomable. Was he ugly? No. Was he
repulsive? No. Was he a woman hater? No. Was
he a criminal? No. Had he offended the fair sex
in any way? No. Was he poor? No. Did he
belong to the human family? Yes. With what
disease then was he afflicted? Was it heredity?
Could he cast the blame upon his ancestors? Up
and down the Thompson valley he searched and
searched but he could find no answer&mdash;even the echo
would not speak. Other fellows seemed to have no
difficulty in getting themselves tangled up in the
meshes of real beautiful love nets. Even the young
bucks who had no visible means of support for their
own apparently useless avoirdupois, picked up the
local gems before his eyes and had them hired out
at interest to supply the new family with bread and
butter. And all this in the face of the fact that <i>he</i>
was one of the most prodigious admirers of womankind
that ever left his footprints on the sands of
Ashcroft.</p><p><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]</span></a></p>

<p>"The most flattering appointment a man can have
is to be chosen the custodian of one woman," he said
to himself. "Life, to a man, is nothing if barred
from an association of this kind."</p>

<p>At last in despair he wrote to a correspondence
paper, and put the whole case before them.</p>

<p>"I am a young man, aged forty-two, unmarried.
I want a solution to the problem why I am unmarried.
I have tried and failed. I have had Cupid
working overtime for me, but he has failed to pierce
any of the bosoms I have coveted. No woman has
ever loved me, and although I am aware that it is
better to have tried and failed than never to have
tried at all, I may say that this affords very poor
manna for my hunger."</p>

<p>He received this answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Young man"&mdash;(emphasis was placed upon the
young)&mdash;"you are too slow. You are asleep, stagnant,
dormant, hibernating. The whole world is
'beating you to it.' Get over your baby superstition
about love, and 'get busy.'"</p>

<p>The letter dropped from his fingers as though it
had been his monthly grocery bill. "Heavens!" he
exclaimed, "here is the solution to the whole mystery.&mdash;Forget
love and 'get busy.'" Instead of
expecting to be loved, he would love. If he could
not get one who would want <i>him</i>, he would get one
he wanted himself.</p>

<p>Now, he had had such an admiration for the fair
sex as a whole, that he could not concentrate his
attention on the individual one. He had been try<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]</span></a>ing
to extract a cinder from the eye of the opposition
when he could not see properly owing to having a
large obstacle in his own eye. However, he proceeded
to "get busy." But what vision would he "get
busy" on? Every woman had an attraction peculiar
to herself, one of which could not be said to extinguish
the other. And then, most of them were
"staked off." One fellow or another had "strings"
on every one he approached. But he kept on fishing
with all his might. In the meantime it came to pass
that the girls continued to cast their spells upon
almost anyone but him; even the itinerant stranger
who just chanced along "hitting the high spots,"
and "travelling on his face" came in for large portions
of the "sweet stuff" that was being cast
lavishly abroad.</p>

<p>It seemed cruel that he who had such an admiration
for those on the other side of the house, and who
had such an ambition to own one as an asset, should
be so unmercifully neglected. His efforts to catch a
wife by the legitimate method, according to his idea,
had ended like a fishing expedition in the off season
in the Thompson river. About this time he found
that the nomads were catching all the fish. He made
up his mind to become a nomad and be a wanderer
on the face of the Cariboo district. He could not
love.</p>

<p>He resigned his position in Ashcroft and migrated
up the Cariboo road. He invaded Lillooet, Clinton,
150 Mile House, Soda Creek, Quesnel, Barkerville
and Fort George. To secure a wife he became an
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]</span></a>itinerant. Within the space of a year he was back
at his position at Ashcroft more lonely than ever.
It was of no avail&mdash;he was hoodooed. He could not
love.</p>

<p>At this juncture he made another and final discovery,
and it was the most important one he had
made at this period of his renaissance. He found
out that "get busy" had two meanings. It meant
"forget love of all kinds and go to it in a business-like
way." This had been a chronic case of a man,
in his ignorance, who was prospecting around the
hills of this British Columbia of ours for a metal
that had no existence. He did not know that ninety
out of every hundred marriages resulted merely from
convenience, or a mere desire to be married on the
part of the man, and the love of a private home on
the part of the woman; that nine out of the remaining
ten were marriages in which one of the parties
only was the love-giver, and that the remaining one
was the ideal, in which love was mutual and beautiful.
This Ashcroft bachelor fellow was a sentimental
monstrosity. He was imbued with the superstition
that one must love, and be loved, before one
could marry. No aphorism could be further removed
from the truth. The glaring realism dawned
upon him that it was quite possible for a person to
flounder through this world and be entirely immune
from the love epidemic; that few people ever marry
the one they do really love, that some are never
sought after by one of the opposite sex during their
whole life, only in a business-like way; that modern
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 65]</span></a>society was too busy to entertain such a silly superstition
as love&mdash;that Cupid was a dead issue. He
had been waiting until he fell in love or till someone
fell in love with him, and thus opportunity had
been knocking at his door all those years in vain.
When he had joined the iconoclast society, and had
shattered this pet idol of his, he began to look
around for a wife in the same manner as he would
for a car of Ashcroft potatoes&mdash;and he soon
"landed" one branded with the "big A." And the
amusing part of it is they lived happily&mdash;all of
which goes to prove our contention that those who
love before marriage are not always the happier
after their nuptials; and sometimes it is a mere
matter of making the best of a bad bargain, and you
will be perfectly happy though married, even if your
stock in trade of the love commodity is very much
impoverished.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Chief_who_was_Bigger_than_He_Looked" id="Of_the_Chief_who_was_Bigger_than_He_Looked"></a>Of the Chief who was Bigger than He Looked</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in the Thompson valley there
lived a mighty warrior kookpi (chief) called
Netaskit. He was chief of all the Shuswaps. His
name had become a household word the entire length
and breadth of the Pacific coast, and the tribes along
the Fraser river and the Pemberton Meadows had
knowledge, through many sad experiences, of his
bravery and daring. Among his own people his
word was law, and to show the white feather in the
face of an enemy meant certain court martial and
death at his hands. Although his subjects feared
him, they respected him beyond belief; and to serve
him was considered a great honor. It is not our purpose
to convey the impression that this kookpi was
cruel, treacherous, cold-blooded and selfish only, and
a man who had no other ambition than war and the
spoils of war. No, if he was a fiend on the battlefield,
he was a lamb at home. He had a soft side
that battled with the concrete in him at times. His
weakness was his insane love for woman, and in his
own kikwilly house (home) he was as timid as the
smumtum (rabbit). His respect for Cupid had as
much avoirdupois as his respect for Mars. His love
for his wife was an insane love&mdash;it far outdid his
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 67]</span></a>love for his chiefdom. And he had a wife who was
worthy of him and as faithful to him as he was to
her&mdash;she adored the very skins he wore across his
shoulders. Being happily united himself, and having
such a respect for Cupid and the fair sex, he
passed a law that no man or woman should take unto
themselves a partner for life until thoroughly satisfied
and convinced that the love flames between
them would be of everlasting duration, and were
genuine.</p>

<p>"Woman," he said, "was made to be loved, and
not enslaved. My consideration for the welfare of
our women exceeds that for our men, because man is
so constituted as to be more able to take care of himself."
So much was this old prehistoric chief away
ahead of his dark, heathen times. But this masculine
weakness of his was nearly his undoing with his
warriors, as we shall see.</p>

<p>One day a rumor went abroad that the Statlemulth
(Lillooet Indians) were making their way through
the Marble Canyon, and down Hat Creek, to attack
the Shuswaps on the Bonaparte, in revenge for some
misdemeanor at some former time, on the part of the
latter. It was just about the time of the year when
the Shuswaps were in the habit of invading the
Fraser river at Pavilion for their winter supply of
salmon; and, to be cut off from this source of revenue
would mean a great deal to the Bonaparte
Indians. The invading army must be met and the
entire band put to death, or made prisoners.</p><p><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]</span></a></p>

<p>Telephone messages in Indian fashion were
flashed from kikwilly house to kikwilly house, and
in a couple of days the entire strength of the Shuswaps
was gathered in a great army with Netaskit at
its head. The march began at an early hour the
following morning, and the enemy was met near the
mouth of the canyon where they had called a halt
for the purpose of hunting and putting up o-lil-ies
(berries). In a moment the air was filled with
war whoops, and the arrows flew thick and fast.
The women took to their heels and ran the moment
the fray began, and they did not stop until they
reached Squilachwah (Pavilion) near the Fraser
river. The smumtum and the groundhog betook
themselves to the high mountains, so great was the
battle, and their fright&mdash;and it is only within
recent years that they have ventured back to that
spot. The battle raged loud and long. Netaskit
was in the thick of the fight and claimed that he had
killed twenty of the enemy with his own bow. Many
were wounded and slain on both sides; but the Shuswaps
won the day, and they led home in triumph
fifty prisoners. And now comes the most interesting
part of our story. A counsel of war was held,
and it was decided that the prisoners should be put
to death the following day. When the time arrived,
the unfortunate men were brought out, bound with
thongs hand and foot and placed in line near the
big chief's wigwam. Fifty victors were lined up in
front of them with their bows and arrows ready to
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]</span></a>shoot at the word of command from their chief, who
was pacing up and down in his dignity and anger.
Suddenly the love demon took possession of him.
He thought of his love for his wife&mdash;her love for
him. He pictured to himself his possible death and
the agony of his widow. He pictured her death and
his own agony of mind at his loss. He shuddered
as the messages flashed through his mind. He looked
at the unfortunate victims&mdash;he thought of their
women&mdash;sweethearts, wives.</p>

<p>"Halt!" he shouted to his men. And turning to
the wretches before him he said:</p>

<p>"Statlemulth! listen. You have committed a
great wrong in making this expedition against the
Shuswaps. The Ko-cha Kookpi (god) is very
angry. You should be shot dead but you can save
yourselves. Listen. I will pardon every man of you
who can produce a wife or a sweetheart who can
prove to my satisfaction that her love for you is
greater than the voice of the Thompson, and fiercer
than the roar of the Fraser."</p>

<p>"Never!" shouted the tribesmen, and every bow
and arrow was turned simultaneously upon the chief.</p>

<p>"Slaves! Cowards!" thundered the enraged and
fearless kookpi, like a mountain lion in pain. In a
moment every bow and arrow fell by its warrior's
side.</p>

<p>As the consequence of this act on the part of his
subjects is of no importance to this story, we will
leave it to the reader's imagination just what sort of
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 70]</span></a>punishment was doled out to them. It is safe to say,
however, that Netaskit was too wise a kookpi to order
the death of so many brave followers, as this means
of gratifying his wounded pride would simply mean
the weakening of the tribe, and would put his own
life in jeopardy.</p>

<p>A message was sent to the Lillooet illihae (country)
with the glad tidings, and at the close of two
days a swarm of smootlatches (women), and keekas
(girls), rushed into camp breathless, and began hysterically
searching for their respective sweethearts
or husbands among the prisoners. The scene was
more than poetic; and it was pathetic in the extreme.
It was a scene that had not occurred before on the
broad surface of the earth&mdash;those fifty distracted
squaws rushing into the jaws of death in their eagerness
to rescue the ones without whom life would be
empty, useless, aimless. It is said that it melted the
heart of the very rocks about the place, so that to this
day the surface of the earth at that spot betrays
evidence of having at one time been running lava.</p>

<p>The captives were lined up before the kookpi's
kikwilly house, and the little army of love-mad
squaws, awful in their primitiveness, rushed at the
line, selected their respective skiuchs (men), and
clung to them, hugged them, kissed them wildly in
the awful heat of their passion, each in her eagerness
to save one at all hazards for her own selfish,
but natural self. And no power on earth could tear
them asunder. It melted the hearts of the victors so
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]</span></a>that they called out with one voice: "Go, you have
won!" and as they moved away shouting, and laughing,
and dancing, Netaskit was seen to weep, so
great was his respect for Cupid.</p>

<p>"O woman! woman!" he was heard to exclaim.
And this is the reason there is so much harmony
between the Statlemulth and the Shuswap to-day.</p><p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]</span></a></p>

<h2><a name="Of_Simple_Simon_Up_To_Date" id="Of_Simple_Simon_Up_To_Date"></a>Of Simple Simon Up To Date</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in Ashcroft there lived a
"Simon" who had no knowledge of the purchasing
value of his salary asset. He did not know that its
buying powers were narrowed down to bread and
butter and overalls; and as a consequence he was
victimized down into a very precarious financial
predicament, to say nothing about the valuable and
most vigorous and productive years of his life, that
were thrown into the scrap heap of time, and had
to be cancelled from his list of revenue-producers.</p>

<p>When you contemplate a steady wage asset of one
hundred dollars per month coming in with the regularity
of clockwork and as sure as the first day comes
around (and the months go by very quickly), you
think you are in a fair way to make some of the local
financiers look very cheap in a few years to come.
Why, this means twelve hundred dollars every time
the earth circumnavigates the sun, and is sixty thousand
dollars in fifty years, which is not very long to
a man if he can start just as soon as he passes the
entrance and can build on no intervening lay-off by
getting on the wrong side of the boss. But when we
offset with our liabilities, such as tobacco money,
moving picture money, car fare, gasoline, rent,
taxes, repairs to the auto, and other trifling incidentals
such as food and clothing, we find at the
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]</span></a>end of the lunar excursion that there is no balance to
salt down on the right side of our ledger, and our
little castle becomes submerged because it was built
with its foundation on the shifting sands.</p>

<p>But for all that, if a man and his money could be
left alone&mdash;if money were not such an envy-producer&mdash;if
a man with money had not so many
friends and admirers and strangers who love him
at first sight&mdash;all might yet be well; and though he
might not outclass some of the most corpulent magnates,
he might in time acquire considerable moss
in his own private, insignificant, Simple-Simon sort
of way. But the laws of nature have willed otherwise,
and the strongest of us know that it is needless
to go into litigation with the laws of gravitation, or
spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p>Among the workings of nature (which some people
say are all for the best), there is a class of men
who have, rather truthfully, been called "sharks"
on account of their fishlike habit of pouncing upon
suckers unawares and without the legal three days'
grace being given, and of loading them into their
stomachs&mdash;finances and all&mdash;before the person has
time to draw and throw his harpoon. It all happens
while you are taking a mouthful of tea, or while you
are reading the locals in the <i>Ashcroft Journal</i>, and
when the spell leaves, you find that you have endorsed
a proposition with a financial payment down,
and the balance subject to call when you are very
much financially embarrassed indeed.</p><p><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span></a></p>

<p>Simple Simon was one of those men who move
about this world unprotected and without having
their wits about them. He was not a sawfish, or
a swordfish. So one day when he was walking up
Railway Avenue&mdash;it was just the day after he had
told someone that he had five hundred dollars of
scrapings salted down, which was earning three per
cent, at the local bank&mdash;a very pretentious gentleman,
spotlessly attired, accosted him:</p>

<p>"Pardon me. Are you Mr. Simon?"</p>

<p>"I have that asset," said Simple, wondering how
the aristocratic stranger had known him.</p>

<p>"I thought so. I knew at a glance. The fact is,
I have just been speaking with Mr. C. Quick." (This
was a lie. Mr. C. Quick was one of the money magnates
of Ashcroft, but had not hired out his name as
an endorsement)&mdash;"and he recommended you to me
as one of the leading men of the town." (This was a
ruse, but it hit the bull's eye, and at the final count
was one of the most telling shots.)</p>

<p>"I am pleased to meet you," said Simple. "And
so am I," said the shark. "As a matter of fact, I
only approach the better part of any community," he
continued, pulling in on the line. "To tell you the
truth, Mr. C. Quick said you were the only man in
the town who had both foundation and substantial
structure from your roots up," and he laughed a
broad sort of "horse-laugh," and slapped Simon on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>"You see, with a proposition such as I have there
is little use going to any but men of the greatest in<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]</span></a>telligence&mdash;those
are the ones who understand the
magnitude and the security and the ultimate paying
certainties of the proposition which I have to offer
you. You may consider yourself fortunate. It is
not everyone who has the opportunity to get in on
the ground floor, as it were, on a sure thing money-accumulating
business. By the way, where is your
office?"</p>

<p>Simon led the shark to his private dug-out on
Brink Street, and showed him into one of his cane-bottomed
thrones, while he himself sat on the yet
unlaundered bed.</p>

<p>"Of course you understand all about joint stock
companies, trust fund companies, municipal bonds
and debentures," said the magnate, unrolling a bundle
of unintelligible papyrus showing assets which did
not exist, and spreading them out on the bed in front
of his victim. The whole system had been premeditated
and had been systematically worked out.
"Now," said the shark, pointing at long and encouraging
figures, "those are assets and these are our
liabilities; and besides we have a million dollar Government
endorsement. Now, the fact of the matter
is this. You have a few dollars. I have a few
dollars; Tom, Dick and Harry have a few dollars,
and so have Jessie and Josie. Now, those little private
funds which we all cherish and fondle, and hug to our
bosoms, and jingle in our pockets, are of no use to
us. They are dead. Of course they are earning three
per cent, at the B.N.A. or the Northern Crown&mdash;what
bank do you deposit with?&mdash;of course, it does
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 76]</span></a>not matter; there is no competition among them;
they pay you three per cent. and charge you ten per
cent. Now, we are very much different. We give
you all your money will make&mdash;if it is ten, twenty,
thirty, fifty, or one hundred per cent. See?</p>

<p>"Now, the fact of the matter is this: as I said
before, those small individual fortunes are of no use
to us individually; they have no earning power; they
will not buy anything. But, put them all together&mdash;ah!
the result is magical. You see, it is the aggregate
that counts. Now with this theory in view, our
company gets to work and canvasses the country and
it gathers together thousands of little, useless, insignificant,
unproductive funds like yours and mine and
joins them together into one vast, giant aggregate
which we call a trust fund. I see it is appealing to
you. It could not be otherwise. Now, with this
aggregate, you, and I, and everyone can own vast
estates, buy forty-year debentures, lend money on
approved security, buy real estate, the unearned increment
of which will net in some cases two or three
hundred per cent. interest, besides an increased valuation
on the original sum invested."</p>

<p>Perhaps every living man in the Dominion of
Canada and the United States who betrays the least
pretensions to having any money in his possession
has heard a harangue of this kind many times in his
life, and it is just as certain that the first time he
heard it he was stung. Now, Simon was no exception
to the rule, which proves that we are not all swordfish.
He felt himself being hypnotized, magnetized,
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 77]</span></a>charmed. He pictured himself as personal owner of
lots, houses, acres&mdash;a joint owner of vast tracts of
land along the G.T.P. or C.N.R.; and the shark
showed him a facsimile of the certificates that would
be issued to him when his shares were paid up in full.
They were very neat and legal-like, and a man should
be proud to own one of them.</p>

<p>"You see," said the magnate, as he realized that
he had the victim falling into his trap, "we do not
require to sell any more shares; we are doing well
enough now, and some say we should leave well
enough alone. But, a corporation of the nature of
ours cannot rest on its oars; we must reach out for
greater and better things, and to accomplish this we
must have more capital. The fact is, a proposition
has just been put to us, the nature of which I am
not just now at liberty to divulge, but it is a sure
winner. But it takes capital, as I said before, and
we are compelled to sell some more stock. And, after
all, it will be you and I who will benefit, and a hundred
or more favored ones who have small savings
which are netting them nothing at present, and the
principal of which is rusting in the bank at three per
cent.</p>

<p>"Now, to come down to business. Will you join
us? Now, I am not going to press you. There are
hundreds too willing; but remember, you will regret
it if you lose this chance of a lifetime. Opportunity
is knocking at your door; seize it by the fore-lock.</p>

<p>"The proposition I have to put before you is this:
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 78]</span></a>We are selling shares at one hundred dollars each,
but if you have not the cash now, we will allow you
six, twelve and eighteen months on the balance with
a payment of five hundred dollars down if you buy
twenty shares. The reason we are able to make such
liberal offers is that we receive the same terms in
buying up debentures."</p>

<p>Simon was completely victimized. His tormentor
might just as well have addressed him in Latin, for
he knew so little about debentures, joint stock funds
and the intricacies of high finance that he could not
follow the promoter and was completely dazzled
with the obscurity and eloquence of the language.
And then the magnate spoke so rapidly that only
lightning could keep up with him. The result was
that Simon fell into the trap and was pinched. He
not only gave away all his rainy day money, but he
burdened himself with a debt, which, to a working
man, was a mountain, and more than he could carry.
He sold his house to meet the next two payments, and
just as the third payment came due the company went
into liquidation, and it consumed all their available
assets to discover that there was nothing left for the
shareholders. And Simple Simon began life over
again.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_High_Class_Eskimo" id="Of_the_High_Class_Eskimo"></a>Of the High Class Eskimo</h2>


<p>Away up in the great northland, even further
north than the northern boundary of British Columbia,
there lives a race of people who form, and have
formed, no part of the great human civilization of the
world which has been, and is going on in the more
moderately climatic regions of the earth. For centuries
they have lived apart, and have taken no notice
of the big world which has been, and is living itself to
death far from them down in the indolent south, where
the sun could shine every day in the year&mdash;where it
did shine every day that it was not cloudy, and where
there was no long, dreary, dark midnight of at least
four months' duration; where the sun did not dip
beneath the horizon at about the beginning of October,
and disappear, not to be seen again until the
end of March; where, in some parts, there was no
snow, while in others only for a few weeks during
the year. No snow! no ice! Can you imagine such
a condition? And up there it is almost the Eskimo's
only commodity. He eats it, drinks it, lives in it,
sleeps on it, and his castle is built of it. And he
endures it year after year, from his babyhood to his
gray days, and there appears no hope for him. Bare
ground is a curiosity to the Eskimo; and there are
no spring freshets. Their bridges across their streams
are formed of ice; the very salt sea is covered with it;
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]</span></a>and they venture out on those great floors of ice in
search of the polar bear and the right whale which
form almost their only food, and supply them with
their only source of clothing, heat and light. In the
midst of his narrow and cramped circumstances the
Eskimo can laugh at times as heartily as any other
human, and he has grown extremely low in stature
to accommodate himself to the small opening which
gives access to his igloo (house). The average man or
woman does not exceed much over four feet. No
other explanation seems to have been offered by
science for the extreme dwarfishness in stature of this
curious race of people.</p>

<p>Like the polar bear&mdash;almost their only associate
in those northern and frozen wilds&mdash;the idea never
occurred to this people to migrate south where the
earth is bare and warm, and is clothed in a green
mantle; where the sun shines every day; where the
land is flowing with milk and honey; where peaches
and water melons grow, and where it is not necessary
to go through a hole in the ice to take a bath.
No, this strange people, whose food is ice, whose
bed is ice, whose home is ice, and whose grave
is ice, are part and parcel of the snowy north;
and they live on, apparently happy and contented
with their hard life and uncongenial environment.
Where the white man begins to be uncomfortable,
the Eskimo begins to be at home. Where
the white man leaves off the Eskimo begins, and his
haunts penetrate away into the far north&mdash;into the
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 81]</span></a>land of perpetual ice and snow. Where we go only to
explore he builds his permanent abode.</p>

<p>But this is not a history of the geographical distribution
of men; it is to be the story of an Eskimo
who went astray according to the moral ideals of his
immediate tribesmen.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived in this northland of
which we have been speaking a young native who had
mysteriously arrived at the conclusion that the life
of an Eskimo was a very narrow and fruitless existence
indeed, and that the conditions under which
they lived were totally inadequate to supply the demands
of a twentieth century human being. In the
midst of the other members of the family he assumed
an attitude of weariness and contempt for his associates
and environs. "One may as well associate
with a polar bear," he soliloquized. "Man was made
to accomplish things; the Eskimo is no further advanced
in the scale of living, organic beings, to all
intent and purpose, than the polar bear, or the walrus.
He is born, lives, eats, sleeps, hunts, kills, dies, and
is buried in the cold frozen earth, if he does not fall
through a hole in the ice into the bottomless sea. To
the south of us is a great healthy world where men
live; where they have discovered all that the world
has to give, and where they enjoy those things to the
utmost; where they read and write and take records
of their doings. Me for the south!" he shouted, and
he made up his mind to migrate at the first opportunity
and be in the swim with men. "I must learn
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]</span></a>to read and write and think, even if I have to forget
my own language," he declared.</p>

<p>Now, it came to pass that as he was soliloquizing
as above one morning, a girl appeared before him.
She was so muffled up in furs that only an Eskimo
could distinguish whether the bundle was male or
female. She sat down beside him and placed her
short, stubby, muffled arm as far around his neck as
it would go, and in this attitude she coaxed, and
begged, and prayed, and argued with him, thinking
that she might resurrect him to himself again. But
when she found that his mania was for the south, she
wept as only woman can weep the whole world over,
even in the far north where the tears are in danger of
freezing to her cheeks. But he, in his brutish, advanced-thought
sort of way, pushed her from him.</p>

<p>"If you love me you will help me to go," he said.
"If you love me you will stay," she responded.</p>

<p>He rose and moved towards his igloo; she followed.
He crawled like a bear through the thirty feet or more
of narrow tunnel which led into the hut proper. She
did likewise. In the igloo he threw himself down on
the ice floor among the squalor and quantities of bear
meat in various stages of decomposition. The smell
from the whale-oil lamp almost choked him. The
girl sat down and continued to cling to him.</p>

<p>"Let me go to the south and I will make a lady of
you," he said. "I will give you gold and silver and
feather beds. These environs are not fit for a bear
to hibernate in. Just think of our branch of the
human family existing and suffering up here among
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]</span></a>the ice and snow for thousands of years and not having
advanced one step from the hovel in which we
were first produced? Is the Eskimo destined to everlasting
failure&mdash;perpetual degeneration? Must you
and I be satisfied and consent to endure this animal
existence to the end of our days because it is our only
heritage from our ancestors? No! I say, a thousand
times no. I am ashamed of myself, my ancestors and
my entire race," he shouted, and the girl almost trembled
in fear of him. He must surely be demented.
But she still clung to him, thinking that her enchanting
presence might cure him. Thus love can be a
very warm thing even up among the cold ice and
snow. Their cold, half frozen cheeks came together
and she kissed him. "Stay," she murmured, coaxingly,
as only a woman can.</p>

<p>"I will take passage south," he continued unheedingly,
"and will plunge myself into the midst of the
big, busy, warm world, and will gain with one bound
that social condition which it has taken the white
man thousands of years to attain."</p>

<p>Now, after all, was this man not right, and is the
Eskimo not to be pitied?</p>

<p>The girl, seeing that her whole world was about to
vanish from her, left the igloo weeping, and again
crawled like a bear through the narrow tunnel to the
colder world outside.</p>

<p>One day when the sun was just about to make its
appearance above the horizon, and the long night was
nearly at an end, two half starved and partially
frozen white men burrowed their way into our hero's
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]</span></a>igloo and asked for food and shelter. The night had
been long, dreary, dark and cold, and the approaching
return of the sun was welcomed like a prodigal. Is
it a wonder then that the Eskimo worships the sun?
It seems his only hope, his only comfort; and it would
seem to him, more than to any other, the source of all
life, his only friend in his dire need. The Eskimo
offered the two strangers some meat, which they devoured
greedily; and then they told a long, pitiful
story. They were explorers. Their ship had been
crushed hopelessly between masses of ice. Fifty had
started on the long journey south. Provisions gave out.
Men had dropped off daily. The trail was one long line
of frozen corpses stretched out in the dark and silent
night. They two alone had survived, so far as the
strangers were able to tell. It was the usual tale of
woe which befalls the Arctic or Antarctic explorers.
Beginning happily, hopefully, buoyantly; ending in
misery, sorrow and death. The strangers wanted a
guide to lead them to the south&mdash;to civilization and
warmth. They had not known what it was to be
comfortable for two years; and they had not seen
one square inch of bare ground during that period.</p>

<p>"Oh, for a sight of mother earth!" they shouted.
"We would gladly eat the soil, and chew the bark
from the trees." Thus one does not appreciate the
most trivial and simple but indispensable things
until one is deprived of them for a period of more or
less duration.</p>

<p>Our hero agreed to guide them so far as his knowledge
extended&mdash;even to the very gateway between
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]</span></a>the north and south lands&mdash;if they would guarantee
to guide him from that point into their own big,
beautiful world further on; they taking the helm
when his usefulness as a guide would be exhausted;
and he explained his ambition to them.</p>

<p>So, one morning when summer was approaching,
and the sun, for the first time in the year was sending
her streamers above the horizon, and when his sweetheart
Lola stood with arms outstretched over the cold
snow and ice towards him, pleading and sending forth
her last appeal to his stony heart, he walked out across
the white table-land towards the south, and was soon
a small black speck in the far horizon.</p>

<p>When the strange expedition reached Dawson they
discarded their hibernating costumes and substituted
more modern ones, not so much because they were out
of fashion, but because they rendered them somewhat
uncomfortable. At this point the white men
grasped the helm and the Eskimo followed. At Fort
Fraser our hero discarded more of his clothing, and
at Quesnel he became determined to strip himself.
"I cannot stand this heat," he said; "why, it will
kill me."</p>

<p>"Heat? Kill you?" exclaimed his two companions.
"Why, the thermometer is scarcely above the freezing
point. If this moderate climate makes you uncomfortable,
what will be your condition in California?
Why, you will melt away like a candle beside a red-hot
stove." And thus they joked with him, not taking
him seriously. So they sailed along and in due
time reached Ashcroft. The Eskimo perspired to
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span></a>such an extent that his condition threatened to become
dangerous. The slightest covering of clothing
became a burden to him, and it was only with the
greatest difficulty that his companions could prevent
him from stripping himself naked. They persuaded
him that he should return before it was too late, but
he would not hear of it. "I have made my nest; I
will sit in it to the bitter end," he said. They
boarded the midnight train, and in a few moments
he was fleeing to the sunny south a great deal faster
than ever dog team or sledge had taken him across
the frozen plateau. And the farther south he went
the more he suffered from the heat, until he was in
great danger of melting away. And then the truth
dawned upon him; it had never occurred to him before.
He was a fish trying to live out of water. He
discovered that what his mind had pictured, and his
heart had longed for, his constitution could not endure.
He was doomed to live and die in the frozen
north. Oh, those savage, unprogressive, half-animal
ancestors! And for the first time he thought of his
igloo, his dog teams, the polar bear, and the little
woman who had pleaded with him to remain; and he
saw her standing as he had left her with outstretched
arms, while her very heart tissue was being torn
asunder. "Oh, for the ice and snow and the long,
dark night," he exclaimed; "anything but this awful
heat." When they reached San Francisco he was
almost insane, and his condition became critical; and,
as if to punish him for his folly, the heat became
intense for a few days. They rushed him to the
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]</span></a>sea shore and he plunged into the water, and refused
to come out again. Those were the most congenial
surroundings he had found since he left the frozen
north. He was in such misery that he did not have
time to enjoy the wonders of civilization which he
had risked so much to see. Thus does distance lend
enchantment to the view. This was an instance of
how a man had grown up with his environment&mdash;had
inherited qualities or weaknesses applicable to his
surroundings, had breathed the air of one planet so
long that the atmosphere of another was poison to
him. He had envied others a lot which it was constitutionally
impossible for him to emulate. And he
wept for his hereditary infirmities and failings.
Could a man be blamed for regretting his ancestors
and cursing the fate, or the necessity which drove
them into those northern fastnesses at the early stages
of their existence? Here again the white man was
to blame, for he, in his eagerness and greed, had
seized upon the cream of the earth for himself and
had driven all inferior or weaker peoples to all the
four corners of the globe. And of all the unfortunate,
subordinate races, the Eskimo was the most unfortunate,
and their condition savored of discrimination
on the part of the powers that governed or ordained
things.</p>

<p>As our hero had only one ambition while in the
north&mdash;an insane notion to go south&mdash;he had only
one ambition while in California&mdash;an overpowering
ambition to go north.</p><p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]</span></a></p>

<p>"Oh, for a mantle of snow, and a canopy of ice!"
he shouted. "And, oh, for one touch on mine of my
Lola's cold, sweet cheek. Oh, for the frozen, hopeless
northland, even if its condition means the perpetual
doom and obliteration of the whole Eskimo race!"</p>

<p>They shipped him north as fast as steam could
carry him, and from Dawson he went on foot, becoming
day by day more and more his natural self. When
he neared his igloo he found his Lola standing with
outstretched arms to welcome him even as she had
mourned his departure, and he realized for the first
time that the love and companionship of one woman
is worth more than all the riches and wonders of the
world put together. They embraced each other with
the grip of a vice, in the awful power of their natures,
and their affection was as genuine as the most civilized
variety. And there he threw himself on the
earth and hugged the snow of his dear northland.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Sweet_Young_Things" id="Of_the_Sweet_Young_Things"></a>Of the Sweet Young Things</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in Ashcroft a very foolish young
man married a very foolish young lady. They were
foolish in so far as they had entered a matrimonial
partnership without the preliminary requisite of love.
He married because he wanted a wife, as all good
men do; she married because she wanted a home, as
all good women do. But, as we have said, they married
too hastily in their eagerness for those mere
mundane pleasures. Each had been known to lie
awake many nights before their marriage summing
up the situation, and putting two and two together;
but, as they were both liberal in their political views,
and had no conservative opposition, the two and two
always made four without a decimal remainder, and
the house voted for marriage with an overwhelming
majority. So they became legally united before they
were morally mature for love, and before they had
formal introduction to the great things of the world.
After the solemnization of their marriage they adjourned
to a beautiful little home which had been
made to order; and it was guarded by a beautiful
garden of Eden.</p>

<p>For a short time everything went merry as the
Ashcroft curlers' ball. Her happiness was all he
lived for, and his comfort was the only excuse she
could find for living. Nothing was too good for his
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]</span></a>Maud; no man was like her Manfred. They each
congratulated themselves that they had hooked the
best fish from the Thompson. There was nothing in
the world outside of their own sweet lives. How
others could live outside of <i>their</i> sphere was a mystery
to them; and the hugs and kisses which they did not
treat themselves to daily would be of no commercial
value as a love asset.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks they spent their evenings
with their tentacles wound around each other so
tightly that they would have passed for one animal;
but they had not been welded by that permanent binding
quality which is essential to perpetual happiness.
Their natures seemed to blend, but it was only a case
of superfluous friendship between them. They had
no reason to fall out, no excuse to quarrel. They
had one mind, one ambition, and they had agreed,
mutually, to salt down a few "plunks" each payday
for their anticipated gray days. In fact, they
seemed better "cut out" for each other than many
who marry loving desperately and savagely.</p>

<p>In a few sweet years they had a few sweet children,
and life was one sweet dream. But they did not love
each other, and without oxygen the lights ultimately
became extinguished. But this was only because the
ironies of fate had discovered that they were too
happy, and that something must be done to damage
their heavenliness.</p>

<p>The honeymoon might, otherwise, have lasted all
their long lives without interruption. But fate decreed
that the clouds should gather from the north,
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]</span></a>south, east and west to obliterate their sun. It happened
in the shape of two monsters in the form of
Flossy and Freddy. Flossy and Freddy were float
rocks. They had been picked up by Maud and Manfred
on their face value and welcomed to the family
circle. They had been assayed at the provincial
assay office and found to contain a valuable percentage
of real collateral; so our hero and heroine could
not be reproached for taking them into their arms
and allowing them the freedom of their home pastures.
But, ah! this is where the evil one sneaked
on to the happy hearth-rug&mdash;they took the strangers
into their arms. They were all young; and, moreover,
human. What could they do when the failings
of their ancestors of a million years took them in an
iron grip and led them in a hypnotic spell toward the
brink of ruin? They were as helpless as the Liberals
in B.C. politics in the year 1912. We have often
quoted that every one must love one of the opposite
sex at least once in a lifetime, and our hero and
heroine were not immune from this stern gravitation
law, because they were only human after all. What was
the consequence? Maud fell hopelessly in love with
Fred, and Manfred lost his conscience, his manhood,
his heart, his soul, his brains, his job and his salary
over the Flossy vision. They had fallen foul of a
strong Conservative party, and civil war broke out.
The former happy couple looked upon each other as
intruders, as disturbers of the peace. While before
they could not get close enough, now they could not
get far enough apart. Manfred would enjoy his
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]</span></a>evenings at the ball or opera with Flossy, while Fred
would entertain Maud, much to her pleasure, at home.
The wife hated to see her husband come home at all,
but she went into hysterics when Fred arrived. When
Fred and Flossy were away, or absent, goodness
knows where, the once happy home was like a lunatic
asylum, in which the mania with the inmates was a
total disregard of each other, and where language was
unknown. The husband and wife drifted further and
further apart. They ceased to smile, ceased to know
each other, ceased to see each other. They were like
a lion and a tiger in the same cage.</p>

<p>As time went on the once happy home became a
horrid prison. The children became detestable brats
who were stumbling-blocks to their ambitions.</p>

<p>Manfred cooked his own meals, or ate at the
"French" Caf&eacute;. Maud had to purchase food and
clothing from the local emporium with money she
had saved up before marriage while waiting table at
the "Best" Hotel. Finance became frenzied, for
Manfred spent both principal, interest and sinking
fund on his affinity. Starvation and the cold world
were staring them in the face, for the wolf and the
collection man were howling at the door. The city
cut off their light and water supply for non-payment
of dues, and were about to seize the property for arrears;
so they were on the water wagon and in darkness,
but still they would not regain consciousness.</p>

<p>The usual course of events did not apply in this
strange case. There was no jealousy floating on the
surface on the part of the husband and wife. Maud
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]</span></a>ignored Manfred's insane attitude towards Flossy because
she had the same love-blind sickness and could
see no one but Fred. Far from being jealous, Manfred
viewed his wife in the light of a white man's
burden which he could not shake off. Christian's
burden was fiction beside it. Flossy was the only
star in his firmament&mdash;the only toad in his puddle.</p>

<p>The children were neglected, and ran wild in the
bush. It was as though some great Belgian calamity
had overtaken the household and had riven it asunder.
The garden lost its lustre, irrigation was discontinued,
the fruit trees lost their leaves prematurely;
the very willows wept. The pickets fell from the
fence unheeded; the stovepipe smoked, and the
chickens laid away in the neighbor's yard. The house
assumed the appearance of a deserted sty. Divorce
was suggested inwardly&mdash;that modern refuge to
which the weak-minded flee in seeking a drastic cure
for a temporary ailment; and all this disruption in
two hearts which had tripped along together so
smoothly and pleasantly. Surely love, misapplied,
is a curse. It is surely sometimes a severe form of
insanity. If so, those two were insane, just waiting
for the pressure to be removed from the brain. And,
theirs was a pitiful and unfruitful case indeed. They
were&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thirst crazed; fastened to a tree,</span>
<span class="i2">By a sweet river running free.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the meantime Fred and Flossy were having
"barrels" of amusement at the expense of the demented
ones. Fred and Flossy were perhaps in the
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]</span></a>wrong in causing such an upheaval in a very model
household. But they were young, and the mischief
had taken root before they suspected that any such
danger was in existence. When the awfulness of the
situation dawned upon them they looked at each other
one day in the interrogative and agreed that the poisonous
weed should be uprooted. But since it had
grown to such proportions it was difficult to arrive
at a means by which the evil could be strangled.
Now Fred and Flossy loved each other, and the lady
was just waiting for the gentleman to put the motion,
so that she would have an opportunity to second it.</p>

<p>The thirst-crazed husband and wife, however, were
too blind to observe that anything unusual existed
between their two friends, and they continued to float
down that smooth but awful river to destruction.</p>

<p>"Why does she not die?" whispered the demon
within the man.</p>

<p>"Why does he not fall into the Thompson and
get drowned for accommodation?" questioned the evil
one in the heart of the woman.</p>

<p>At last the eruption became "Vesuvian," and the
ashes from the crater threatened to re-bury Pompeii&mdash;we
mean Ashcroft. Thoughts of suicide as the only
means of relief bubbled up at intervals.</p>

<p>"Give me love or give me death," they shouted
when the fever was at its highest.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say just how this war would
have ended if an unforeseen neutral incident had
not brought an influence to bear which made a con<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 95]</span></a>tinuation
of the conflict an impossible and aimless
task.</p>

<p>One day the deaf, and dumb, and blind husband
and wife were sitting by the neutral hearth as far
apart as it was possible to be removed and yet be able
to enjoy the friendly heat of the neutral air-tight
heater. The neutral cat jumped up on the husband's
knee, but in his belligerent mood he dashed it to the
floor. The wife picked it up and stroked its sleek fur.
The neutral children were out in the garden abusing
the flowers and breaking pickets from the fence; and
one had an old saw and was sawing at the trimmings
of the cottage like a woodsman sawing down a cedar
at the coast.</p>

<p>There was rustling of a lady's skirt, and the tramp
of hurried feet on the garden path outside. The next
moment the door was pushed open and Fred and
Flossy dashed in, laughing like to split their sides.</p>

<p>"You tell them," said Fred.</p>

<p>"No, you," said Flossy, blushing deeply.</p>

<p>"No, you," said Fred, and he seized Flossy's hand.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Fred has&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"To make a long story short," said Fred, "we are
to be married, and the date has been fixed for June."</p>

<p>When Vesuvius buried up Pompeii the people
could not have been more horrified than the belligerent
husband and wife. They looked at each other
for the first time in six months. The man pitied the
woman, and cursed himself for crossing swords with
her. The woman at once recognized her husband as
a hero, and was ashamed of herself. They each
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]</span></a>waited for the other to make the first confession, but
it was left to both. They sprang into each other's
arms and became welded for life in one beautiful
but awful squeeze.</p>

<p>The fright had cured them. It had opened their
eyes to the realization of the ridiculousness of the
situation, and revealed the criminality of their past
behavior.</p>

<p>The volcano ceased to pour forth lava. The earth-tremblings
became still. The sun peeped out from
behind the clouds. Manfred got back his job on the
railway. The water and light arrears were paid up.
The fence was repaired, and the garden irrigated.
The children were called in from the woods and
curried down. Kisses and smiles took the place of
scowls and curses. The sideboard was replenished,
and the hens were persuaded to work for their own
family. Even the willows ceased to weep; and, oh,
my! but it was a beautiful resurrection. And thus
Paradise was gained again.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Two_Ladies_in_Contrast" id="Of_the_Two_Ladies_in_Contrast"></a>Of the Two Ladies in Contrast</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in Ashcroft two ladies were
thrown into the same society; because in Ashcroft
there is only one class. When any function took
place the glad hand was extended to one and all. For
every dollar possessed by one of the ladies' husbands
the other husband had five. Mrs. Fivedollars was
very extravagant in her dress and domestic department,
and Mrs. Onedollar was very envious and ambitious.
The husband of the one dollar variety was
more or less of a henpeck because he could not multiply
his income by five and produce a concrete result.</p>

<p>It was a very predominating mania with Mrs. Onedollar
to shine in society with as great a number of
amperes as her rival; and this ambition gave rise to
one of the greatest domestic civil wars that Ashcroft
has even seen. Mrs. Fivedollars had no envy. There
was no corner in the remote recesses of her heart
rented by this mischievous goddess. She made no
effort to "outfashion" fashion or to outshine her
neighbors. What she displayed in dress did not extend
beyond the natural female instincts for attire.
Of course she had no cause to be envious, being by far
the best dressed lady in town without undue effort.
Mrs. Onedollar viewed the situation from a social
apex, and the more she studied the situation the more
she realized that the world was discriminating against
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 98]</span></a>her. From being the best of friends, they developed
into the most deadly of enemies.</p>

<p>Now, it came to pass that the husbands of those two
ladies were the best of friends. They met frequently
in the "Best" and "Next Best" hotels and drank
healths in the most harmless and jolly manner. They
often met at their places of business and exchanged
ideas. They had business relations with each other
which terminated to the advantage of both. To quarrel
with each other, to them, was much the same as to
quarrel with their bread and butter. They had absolutely
no ambitions with regard to their personal
appearance. They had a suit of clothes each; when
that was old or shabby they got another one. But, in
this respect, man is very different from woman. All
man wants is covering; a woman must have ornament,
and she must equal, if not outshine, her neighbor.
The tension between the two ladies became greater
until it was almost at the breaking point. Several
attempts had been made by the distracted husbands
to unscrew the strings which they knew were about to
snap, but the result was nil.</p>

<p>"The vixen," said the one. "The hussy," said the
other; and when two ladies develop the habit of calling
each other such queer pet names, a reconciliation
seems very remote indeed.</p>

<p>The climax came at the annual Clinton ball. This
was one of those historic functions to which everyone
is extended a hearty invitation, and it is one of the
great events of the season. The entire Lillooet, Yale
and Cariboo districts participate&mdash;it is a regular
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]</span></a>meeting of the clans. And that year was no exception.
All our friends were there, including our
heroes and heroines. The music was throwing its
waves of delightful chords through the hall and over
the heads of the throng of dancers. Something happened!
No one knew just what it was, but in the
middle of the floor two ladies were seen tearing each
other's hair and draperies. Heavens! it was our two
heroines. The tension had reached the limit&mdash;the
strings were broken. In a moment our two heroes
were on the scene, and each one seized his bundle
of property and rushed with it to safety. The two
ladies were bundled into their autos and hurried
home to Ashcroft in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>The next day a council of war was held by the two
husbands and it was unanimously agreed that something
must be done.</p>

<p>"I have it!" exclaimed Mr. Fivedollars. "Now,
listen. I will take you in as a partner in business. I
will give you twenty years to pay your share, and we
will dress our wives exactly alike." The plan was
adopted, and the result was phenomenal. Mr. Onedollar
had at last multiplied his insignificant unit by
five and had a concrete accumulation. The two ladies
dressed themselves alike extravagantly, and all
rivalry ceased. They became great friends again and
lived happily ever after. And all this disturbance
and discord of human hearts was over a miserable
bundle of inanimate drapery.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Ruse_That_Failed" id="Of_the_Ruse_That_Failed"></a>Of the Ruse That Failed</h2>


<p>Once upon a time in Ashcroft there lived a lady
who had the wool pulled over her husband's eyes to
such an extent that he had optical illusions favorable
to the "darling" who deceived him. His most alluring
illusion was a booby idea that his "pet" was an
invalid, and she kept pouring oil on the joke to keep
it burning, and pulled the wool down further and
further so that hubby could not see the combustible
fluid she was pouring into the flames. Her illness
was one of those "to be continued" story kinds&mdash;better
to-day, worse to-morrow&mdash;and she "took" to
the blankets at the most annoying and inopportune
moments; and every time she "took" an indisposition
she expected hubby to pull down the window
curtains and go into mourning. But he, the hardhearted
man, would continue to eat and smoke and
sleep as though no volcanic lava were threatening to
submerge the old homestead. His sympathy was not
enough; he should stop eating, stop sleeping, and stop
smoking&mdash;he should be in direct communication with
the undertaker and negotiating about the price of
caskets.</p>

<p>His wife had the misleading conviction that when
she was ill her case was more serious than that of
anyone else. In fact, no one else had ever suffered
as she suffered; their ailments were summer excur<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]</span></a>sions
to the antipodes compared with hers, and when
hubby argued that all flesh was subject to ills and
disorders, that almost every unit of the human species
had toothaches and rheumatics, the argument was
voted down unanimously by the suffragette majority
as illegitimate argument.</p>

<p>Gradually hubby became convinced that his wife
was an invalid, and he went into mourning as much
as a man could mourn the loss of a joy that he had
grasped for, and just missed in the grasping. He
enjoyed the situation as much as a man could
who had discovered that he had amalgamated
himself with an hospital which was mortgaged
for all it was worth to the family physician.
Out of his salary of seventy-five dollars per month
sixty-five was devoted towards the financing of the
doctor's time payments on his automobile; the balance
paid for food, clothing, water, light, and fuel, and
supplied the wolf with sufficient allowance to keep
him from entering the parlor in the concrete. But
the philosopher, as all men must ultimately become,
concluded to make the best of his bad real estate investment.
He resigned himself to a life of perpetual,
unaffected martyrdom. After all, it was his personal
diplomacy that was at fault&mdash;he should not have
bought a pig in an Ashcroft potato sack.</p>

<p>During the first year of their matrimonial failure
they had rooms at the "Best" Hotel, and the girls
carried breakfast to the bride's room seven mornings
of every week at about 10.30, where the "invalid"
devoured it with such greed and relish that they be<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 102]</span></a>came
suspicious and talked "up their sleeves" about
her. Three days each week she had all meals carried
up to her, and the girls wondered how she could distribute
so much proteid about her system with so
little exercise. The extreme healthfulness of her
constitution was the only thing that saved this woman
from dying of surfeit. The only occasions on which
she would rise from her lethargy was to attend a
dance or social of some kind given at Walhachin or
Savona&mdash;she did not avoid one of them, and on those
occasions she would be the liveliest cricket on the
hearth, the biggest toad in the puddle, while the
husband was pre-negotiating with the physician for
some more evaporated stock in the auto. How she
ever got home was a mystery, for she would be more
disabled than ever for weeks to come. Of course she
had just overdone her constitutional possibility&mdash;she
said so herself, and she should know.</p>

<p>Whispers went abroad that she was lazy, and they
became so loud that hubby heard them over the wireless
telephone. He became exasperated. "My wife
a hypocrite? Never! The people have hearts of
stone&mdash;brains of feathers&mdash;they do not understand."</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it had never occurred to him before&mdash;he
suggested that they consult a specialist in somnolence.
But she would not hear of it; there was nothing wrong
with her; all she wanted was to be left alone. In a
short time hubby began to consider her in the light of
a "white man's burden," and had distorted visions of
himself laboring through life with an over-loaded
back action.</p><p><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 103]</span></a></p>

<p>One day the hotel proprietor advised him of a contemplated
raise in his assessment to re-imburse the
business for extras in connection with elevating so
much food upstairs, which was not part and parcel
of the rules and regulations of the house in committee.
Besides, the accommodation was needless.</p>

<p>"Needless!" exclaimed hubby. "Would you degenerate
a lady and gentleman wilfully. I will leave
your fire-trap at once and cast anchor at the 'Next
Best.'" The proprietor argued that his competitor
was welcome to such pickings, so he made no comment
on the debate.</p>

<p>The "Next Best" was "full up," as it always is,
so they carried the living corpse out on a stretcher,
and hubby went batching with his burden in a three-roomed
house on Bancroft Street. When it became
hubby's duty to cook the meals and carry half of them
to bed for his better half every morning before breakfast
he began to taste silly and smell sort of henpeck
like. He persisted humbly, lovingly, self-sacrificingly,
henpeckedly, however, until one morning his
sun rose brighter than it had ever done before and
he saw a faint glimmer of light through the wool that
was hanging in front of him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is such a commodity as superfluous
personal sacrifice to one's matrimonial obligations,"
he soliloquized. "Perhaps this spouse of mine with
the pre-historic constitution can be cured by an abstract
treatment. Is she ill, or is she playing a wild,
deceitful part? Is she sitting on me with all her
weight?" He was willing to allow her the usual pro<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]</span></a>portion
of female indisposition, but a continued story
of such nightmare proportions was beginning to unstring
his physical telephone system. So, to we
who have no wool over our eyes, this was one of the
most pitiful and criminal cases of selfish indolence,
perhaps coupled with a belief that a husband, through
his sympathy, will love a woman the more because of
her suffering. No supposition, of course, could be
farther from the concrete&mdash;a husband wants, requires,
admires, loves, a healthy, active working-partner.
Failing this the husband as a husband is
down and out.</p>

<p>When hubby began to realize this an individual
reformation was at the dawning. The very next
morning no breakfast arrived by private parcel post.</p>

<p>"Harry," she exclaimed, "bring me my porridge
and hot cakes; I am starving."</p>

<p>"If you are starving get up and eat in your stall
at the table," said Harry, sarcastically, although it
pained him.</p>

<p>"Harry!" she shouted, "you selfish beast!"</p>

<p>For diplomatic reasons Harry was silent.</p>

<p>Harry made an abrupt exit without waiting for
adjournment, and went up town. A new life seemed
to be dawning upon him. It was the emancipation
from slavery. He went into the drug store, into the
hardware store, into the hotels and all the other stores&mdash;he
talked and laughed as he had never done before.</p>

<p>It was 3 a.m. the following morning when he found
himself searching for the door-knob in the vicinity of
the front window. Having gained an entrance, he
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]</span></a>was accosted by his wife, who exclaimed: "Harry,
you drunk?"</p>

<p>"Well, y'see, it was the pioneer shupper," said
Harry, and he tumbled into bed.</p>

<p>This was Harry's first ruse. His next move was
an affinity. He would cease to pose as a piece of
household furniture&mdash;a dumb waiter sort of thing.</p>

<p>At that time there was a vision waiting table at
the "Best" who had most of the fellows on a
string. Harry threw his grappling irons around her
and took her in tow. This went on for some time
without suspicion being aroused on the part of the
"invalid," but the wireless telegraphy of gossip whispered
the truth to her one day when she was wondering
what demon had taken possession of her protector.
She dropped her artificial gown in an instant and
rushed up Railway Avenue like a militant suffragette.
Just about the local emporium Harry was sailing
along under a fair and favorable wind, hand in hand
with his new dream, when he saw his legal prerogative
approaching near the "Next Best" hotel. He
dislodged his grappling-hooks in an instant, stepped
slightly in advance, and feigned that he had been
running along on his own steam. But she saw him
and defined his movements. They met like two express
engines in collision, and what followed had
better be left buried underneath the sidewalk of the
local emporium. There were dead and dying left on
the field, and they reached home later by two rival
routes of railway.</p><p><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 106]</span></a></p>

<p>The stringency endured some days, which time she
huffed and he read Charles Darwin. At the end of
that period the ice broke, as it always does; the clouds
rolled away, and the sun began to shine, and they began
to negotiate for peace. They had a long sitting of
parliament, and it was moved and seconded, and
unanimously carried, that each give the other a reprieve.
It meant the amalgamation of two hearts
that became so intertwined with roots that nothing
earthly could pull them asunder. It was the founding
of one of the happiest homes in Ashcroft. He
left his affinity&mdash;she left her bed. They became active
working partners. Long years after he told her of his
ruse. She laughed.</p>

<p>"You saved me," she said.</p>

<p>He endorsed the note, and they had one long, sweet
embrace which still lingers in their memory.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<h3>CHRISTMAS EVE</h3>


<p>Once upon a time it was Christmas eve in Vancouver,
B.C., and the snow was falling in large, soft
flakes. The electric light plants were beating their
lives out in laborious heart-throbs, giving forth such
power that the streets and shop windows had the
appearance of the phantom scene of a fairy stage-play
rather than a grim reality; they were lighter
than day. There was magic illumination from the
sidewalk to the very apex of the tallest sky-scraper.
Being Christmas eve, the streets were thronged with
pleasure seekers, and eager, procrastinating, Christmas
gift maniacs. They were all happy, but they
were temporarily insane in the eagerness of their pursuit.
They all had money, plenty of it; and this was
the time of year when it was quite in order to squander
it lavishly, carelessly, insanely&mdash;for, is it not more
blessed to give than to receive?</p>

<p>The habiliments of the hurrying throng were
exuberant, extravagant and ostentatious in the extreme.
Everyone seemed to vie with every other,
with an envy akin to insanity, for the laurels in the
fashion world, and they were talking and laughing
gaily, and some of them were singing Christmas
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 108]</span></a>carols. They did not even seem to regret the soft wet
snow that was falling on their costly apparel and
soaking them&mdash;they seemed rather to enjoy it. Besides,
they could go home at any time and change and
dry themselves&mdash;and, was it not Christmas, the one
time of the year when the whole world was happy and
lavish? The persons of the ladies were bathed in
perfume, and the clothing of the gentlemen was spotless,
save where the large, white snowflakes clung for
a moment before vanishing into fairyland. Vancouver
was certainly a city of luxury, a city of ease,
a city of wealth, and it was all on exhibition at this
time of approaching festival. Everyone was rich, and
money was no obstacle in the way of enjoyment.</p>

<p>But we have seen one side of the picture only. We
have been looking in the sunlight; let us peer into
the shadows. There was a reverse side. A girl of
about thirteen years of age was standing at the corner
of Hastings and Granville offering matches for
sale to the stony world. She was bareheaded, thinly
clad, shivering. Her clothing was tattered and torn.
Her shoes were several sizes too large, and were some
person's cast-off ones. It was Christmas, and no one
was seeking for matches. They were all in search of
gold and silverware, furs and fancies, to give away
to people who did not require them.</p>

<p>"Matches, sir?" The solicitous question was addressed
to a medium-sized, moderately dressed man
who was gliding around the corner and whistling
some impromptu Christmas carol; and she touched
the hem of his garment. This unit of the big world
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 109]</span></a>paused, took the matches, and began to explore his
hemisphere for five cents. In the meantime he surveyed
the little girl from head to foot, and then he
glanced at the big world rushing by in two great
streams.</p>

<p>"Give me them all!" he said with an impulse that
surprised him, and he handed her one dollar. "Now,
go home and dry yourself and go to bed," he continued.
He did not stop to consider that she might
not have a home and a bed, but continued on his way
with his superfluity of matches. His home was
bright, and warm, and cheery when he arrived there,
and his wife welcomed him. "I have brought you a
Christmas present," he said, and he handed her the
matches. When she opened the package he found it
necessary to explain.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<h3>CHRISTMAS</h3>

<p>It was Christmas, and the snow was still falling in
large, soft flakes. It was about ten inches deep out
on the hills, among the trees out along Capilano and
Lynn Creeks, but it had been churned into slush on
the streets and pavements of Vancouver. The church
bells were ringing, and our gaily clad and happy
acquaintances of the evening before were again
thronging the streets; but to-day they were on their
way to church to praise the One whose birthday
they were observing. Our friend of the large heart
was also there, and so was his wife&mdash;two tiny drops
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]</span></a>in that great bucketful of humanity. The match
vendor was also there&mdash;another very tiny drop in that
great bucketful. "What! Selling matches on
Christmas day?" remarked a passer-by. "You should
be taken in charge by the Inquisition."</p>

<p>"Matches, sir?" said the tiny voice, and she again
touched the hem of our hero's garment. The big-hearted
man looked at his tender-hearted wife, and
the tender-hearted wife looked at her big-hearted
man. "Yes, give me them all," he said again, and
he handed her another dollar. He was evidently
trying to buy up all the available matches so that he
could have a corner on the commodity. "Here," he
continued, "take this dollar also. Buy yourself
something good for Christmas, and go home and
enjoy yourself."</p>

<p>"I have no home, and the shops are all closed,"
she said, brushing the wet snow from her hair.</p>

<p>"No home!" exclaimed the lady, incredulously,
"and the world is overflowing with wealth and has
homes innumerable. Is it possible that the world's
goods are so unevenly divided?"</p>

<p>The girl began to cry.</p>

<p>"Come and have your Christmas dinner with us,"
said the lady.</p>

<p>The girl, still weeping, followed in her utter innocence
and helplessness.</p>

<p>Ding-dong, went the merry bells. Tramp, tramp,
went the feet of the big, voluptuous world. Honk,
honk, went the horns of the automobiles; for
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 111]</span></a>it was Christmas, and all went merry as a marriage
bell.</p>

<p>The fire was burning brightly. The room was
warm and cozy. The house was clean, tidy, and
cheery. It was a dazzling scene to one who had been
accustomed to the cold, bare, concrete pavements only.</p>

<p>"My!" exclaimed the girl as they entered. It
was a perfect fairyland to her. It was a story. It
was a dream.</p>

<p>"Now, we are going to have the realest, cutest,
Christmas dinner you ever saw," said the lady, producing
a steaming turkey from the warming oven.
The girl danced in her glee and anticipation. "But
first you must dress for dinner. We will go and see
Santa Claus," smiled the foster-mother. She retired
with a waif, and returned with a fairy, and
they sat down to a fairy dinner.</p>

<p>"What a spotless tablecloth! What clean cups
and saucers, and plates and dishes! What shining
knives and forks! What kind friends!" thought the
orphan. "I had no idea such things existed outside
of Heaven," she exclaimed aloud in her rapture.</p>

<p>"It is all very commonplace, I assure you," said
the man, "but it takes money to buy them."</p>

<p>"And yet," philosophized the lady, "if we are
dissatisfied in our prosperity, what must a life be that
contains nothing?"</p>

<p>Ding-dong, went the bells. Tramp, tramp, went
the feet of the big world outside. Honk, honk, went
the horn of the automobile; but the happiest heart of
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]</span></a>them all was the little waif who had been, until now,
so lonely, so cold, so hungry, so neglected. They
were the happiest moments in her whole life. Her
time began from that day. But that is many years
ago. The orphan is a lady now in Vancouver; and
every Christmas she gives a dinner to some poor
people in honor of those who adopted her and saved
her from the slums.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Retreat_from_Moscow" id="Of_the_Retreat_from_Moscow"></a>Of the Retreat from Moscow</h2>


<p>Once upon a time four Ashcroft Napoleons, known
locally as "Father," "Deacon," "Cyclone," and
"Skookum," invaded Vancouver to demonstrate at
an inter-provincial curling bonspiel that was arranged
to take place at that city. Their object was to bring
home as many prizes and trophies as they could conveniently
carry without having to pay "excess baggage,"
and donate the balance to charity. It was
decided later not to take any of the prizes, as it was
more blessed to give than to receive, and they did
not only give away all the trophies, but they gave
away all the games as well&mdash;games they had a legitimate
mortgage on&mdash;and they were glad to see the
other fellows happy.</p>

<p>As a man often gets into trouble trying to keep out
of it, so the Ashcroft chaps lost by trying to win;
and here it is consoling to know that all a man does
or says in this world sinks and lies motionless in the
silent past, for in this case it will only be a matter
of time when people will cease to remember. But to
leave all joking aside, we beg to advise that the
adventurers were dumped unceremoniously into Moscow
by the C.P.R. officials at about three good morning
and had not where to lay their heads. You could
not see the city for buildings; but even at that embryo
hour of the morning the streets were not en<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 114]</span></a>tirely
deserted. Some people seem to toil day and
night, for there were dozens of forms moving hither
and thither like phantoms in the powerful glare of
the electric illuminations. Being Ashcroft people
our heroes were accustomed to city life, and the embarrassment
of the situation soon evaporated. They
bundled themselves into a nocturnal automobile which
was no sooner loaded than it "hit" the streets of
Vancouver like Halley's comet. It went up and
down, out and in, hither and thither. It tried to
leap from under the invaders, but they kept up with
it. It went north forty chains, east forty chains,
south forty chains, and thence west forty chains to
point of commencement. It went here, then there,
and ultimately arranged to stop on Richards Street
(named after our John), at the foot of the elevator
of the Hotel Canadian. This was the end of steel for
the auto, the rest of the journey had to be made on
foot via the elevator. It is a very pleasant sensation
to have the floor rise and carry you with it to the
third landing, and it only takes three seconds to make
a sixty second journey. At the third floor, after
having been shown their stalls for the night, the
bandits went out on an exploring expedition while the
stable man let down some hay.</p>

<p>They located the fire escape, as it is always better
to come in by the front door like a millionaire and
leave by the fire escape in the dead of the night when
the stableman is asleep at his post.</p>

<p>Early next morning, at about ten o'clock, they invaded
the dining-room as hungry as hyenas, and had
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 115]</span></a>a lovely breakfast of porridge and cream, ham and
eggs, toast and butter, tea or coffee. To encourage
the coffee somewhat the Deacon "dug" his front foot
into the lump-sugar bowl and extracted a couple of
aces; and the other mimics followed suit with two,
three, and four spots. The breaking of this fast cost
forty-five cents for the meal, and fifty-five for the
waiter just to make the "eat" come to even money,
and they were too large socially to take away small
change economically. Every meal they put into their
waste baskets necessarily extracted one day from the
other end of their excursion via the fire escape, and
that is one reason why they returned so soonly. Cyclone,
having drawn on his personal account at a
Vancouver branch of the Ashcroft bank for enough
to pay his next meal and car fare, and Skookum having
jotted down the usual morning poetic inspiration
on the sublimity of the situation, the army, led by
Father, marched full breast upon the curling rink
building. There were no knights at the gate to
defend the castle, nor did the band meet them at the
portal&mdash;neither did the Vancouver curling club.
Their arrival, strange to say, created no commotion;
they did not seem to have been anticipated. Things
went along as though nothing extraordinary had
taken place.</p>

<p>The appearances at the rink, however, were intoxicating,
which largely made up for the invisibility
of the receiving committee. The rink was somewhat
larger than the town hall at Ashcroft, and the great,
high, arched, glass ceiling was studded with electric
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]</span></a>lights like stars in the heavens. Extensive rows of seats
for spectators encircled the entire room, and in the
centre, the arena was one clear, smooth sheet of hard,
white ice. Several games were in progress, and they
saw their old friend "Tam" playing with his usual
Scotch luck and winning for all he was worth.</p>

<p>Ashcroft selected the ice upon which the first blood
was to be sprinkled. The battle began on schedule
time, and as they had anticipated, they won without
a single casualty. As a result of this "clean up,"
a private conference was held that night by the Vancouver
and other clubs behind closed doors, at which
it was moved, and seconded, and adopted, that Ashcroft
was a dangerous element in their midst, and
that drastic measures must be set in motion at once
to arrest such phenomenal accomplishments or the
bonspiel would be lost. All unconscious of the conspiracy
against them, Ashcroft spent the afternoon
riding up and down the moving stairs at Spencer's,
led by the "Deak," who had had previous practice at
this amusement. Curling to them was as easy as this
stairway, and as simple as eating a meal if you cut
out the tipping of the waiter. That night they took in
a show which was a "hum dinger," and should have
endured a life-time. What a sweet life it was;
nothing to do but live, and laugh, and curl, and win;
if it would only continue indefinitely without having
to worry about the financing of it! Napoleon "had
nothing" on Father, and he felt that he could even
"put it over" on the local star. But something
happened the next day. Whether it was the private
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]</span></a>conference, or the moving stairs, or the Pantages, or
whether it was that Ashcroft became more careless
with success, and Vancouver more careful with defeat,
will never be known. They pierced no more bull's
eyes&mdash;and sometimes they missed the entire target.
They had every qualification essential to the successful
curler but talent. They had the rocks, the brooms,
the ribbons, the sweaters&mdash;they even had the will.
It is strange with all those requisites that they could
not win.</p>

<p>The retreat from Moscow took place three days
later, and they went straggling over the Alps in one
long string. As though the mortification of defeat
was not enough, a huge joke was prepared for them
by the reception committee of the local curling club,
and lemons have been at a premium in Ashcroft ever
since.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_Sicamous" id="Of_Sicamous"></a>Of Sicamous</h2>


<p>The Okanagan Valley, in the Province of British
Columbia, is bounded on the north by the mosquitoes
at Sicamous, and on the south by the forty-ninth
parallel of north latitude, which is the United States;
and to one who is accustomed to the sand and the
sage, the general aspect throughout gives a most
pleasing rest to the eye. A trip to the Okanagan is
like one sweet dream to the inhabitants of the dry
belt&mdash;a dream that is broken only once by a dreadful
nightmare&mdash;the mosquito conquest at Sicamous; but
you forgive and forget this the moment after you
awake. The mosquitoes at Sicamous are as great a
menace to that town as the Germans are to Europe.</p>

<p>The train for the valley, when on time, leaves
Sicamous, on the main line of the C.P.R., at about
ten, good morning, but sometimes she waits for the
delayed eastern train. This happens very frequently
on Sundays&mdash;for who or what was ever on time on a
Sunday? Sunday is the lazy man's day&mdash;the lazy
day of the world&mdash;the day on which we creep along
out of tune with things.</p>

<p>Now, when you get side-tracked at a C.P.R. station
in the Rocky Mountains waiting for a delayed
eastern train, you may as well throw all your plans
into the lake, because they will be out of fashion
when you have an opportunity to use them again,
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]</span></a>and you will require new ones&mdash;the train may come
to-day and she may not come till to-morrow. But, if
that station chances to be Sicamous, and it is Sunday&mdash;and
it must be raining heavily, for when it is
raining there are no mosquitoes&mdash;you will not regret
the delay, and you will be very much interested if
you have an eye for the unique, or if you have the
slightest inclination to be eccentric you will be reminded
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There are friends we never meet;</span>
<span class="i2">There is love we never know.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Here people&mdash;strangers and friends&mdash;meet and nod,
smile, talk and depart ten or twelve times every day.
You will wonder how people can talk so much, and
what they get to talk about&mdash;people who meet accidentally
here, only for a moment, and will never meet
again, perhaps. Almost hourly, night and day, cosmopolitan
little throngs jump from trains, chat a
few moments among themselves, or with others who
have been waiting, and then allow themselves to be
picked up by the next train and rushed off into eternity&mdash;that
is, so far as you are concerned, for you
will never see them again&mdash;and some of them were
becoming so familiar. They are voices and faces flitting
across your past; they are always new, always
strange, always interesting; they are laughing, chatting,
smiling, scowling, worrying. There are fair
faces and dark faces, pleasant faces and angry faces,
careless faces and anxious faces, and faces that are
thin, fat, long and short. The voices are as varied as
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]</span></a>the faces. There is the sharp, clear voice and the
dull voice, the angry one and the pleasant one. There
are young and old, beautiful and ugly, scowls and
smiles, the timid and the fearless&mdash;the black, the
white, and the yellow; and there are faces that look
so much like ones you know at home that you are
just on the point of asking them how the boys and
girls have been since you left. If they had known
that they were the actors on a stage, and you were the
audience, conditions might have been improved&mdash;artificially;
they might have acted better, with more
"class," but the interest would have been injured;
you would have been robbed of a genuine entertainment.
Those people went north, south, east and west;
they went to the four corners of the earth. The sound
of their voices and laughs go up into the tree-tops, up
into the hills and down into the lake, and they are
echoed back to us; and that is the only record that is
ever taken, of this interesting drama; and then the
voices fade away east&mdash;fade away west.</p>

<p>But you hear the elaborate puffing and snorting of
a locomotive as though laboring under its great load
of humanity; there is a loud whistle from somewhere,
and then another; two engines are speaking
to each other; then the bell rings, the engine sweeps
by, and the whole earth trembles&mdash;it is the delayed
eastern train. There is a great scramble for entrance.
Chance acquaintances are forgotten in the individual
excitement. The steps to one car are blocked by one
man who has enough baggage for ten, and one worried-looking
young lady with a baby is afraid she will
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]</span></a>lose her train. The train pulls out with a "swish,
swish" of escaping steam under great pressure
from the engine, and the station is robbed of
half its population. The familiar faces have
disappeared, but a new throng has been cast
into your midst&mdash;new faces, new smiles, new voices,
new scowls; and the chatter is renewed with
vigor when we have found ourselves, and are located
in several little isolated bunches. But the Okanagan
local is here waiting for our scalps. There is another
scramble of men, women, children, bag and baggage,
for seats, and we are off. The little station platform
is deserted and silent but for the clatter of the wheels
of the baggage truck. The tree tops sigh, the lake
murmurs, but they cannot hold us, we must hurry to
the great beyond&mdash;the whole world depends upon our
individual movements.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Ubiquitous_Cat" id="Of_the_Ubiquitous_Cat"></a>Of the Ubiquitous Cat</h2>


<p>Once upon a time I had a very curious experience
which had a very curious ending.</p>

<p>I walked into a strange person's house, uninvited,
for some mysterious reason perfectly unknown to
myself.</p>

<p>Sitting promiscuously around an old-fashioned
fire-place, in which blazed a cheery fire, were a
man and woman and four small children; and on a
lounge, partly hid under the eiderdown quilt, lay a
pure white cat, half asleep and half awake, and at
intervals casting sly glances at some of the children.
The cat seemed to all intent and purpose one of that
human family.</p>

<p>Now, although the cat can be abused like a toy
doll by the children without losing his temper, yet
he has the most curiously composed disposition of all
the domestic animals. Although extravagantly domesticated,
and although he shares our beds and
tables with impunity, yet he is, to the mouse, as
cruel and treacherous as a man-eating tiger.</p>

<p>However, we did not take up our pen to discuss
cat psychology. Upon entering the strange person's
house so unceremoniously, I sat me down upon a
vacant chair, also uninvited, and began to make myself
at home.</p>

<p>The strange persons did not seem to take any
exception to my strange behavior, but, kept on talking
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 123]</span></a>as though nothing extraordinary had taken place in
the human social regulations. I was more interested
in the cat than I was in the people, and I could not
keep my eye from him, he was so much like our
"Teddy" at home.</p>

<p>At last I convinced myself that it <i>was</i> Teddy.</p>

<p>"Where did you get that cat?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, we have always had him. We raised him.
He sleeps with the children every night, and gets up
with them in the morning&mdash;when he is here," said
the mother.</p>

<p>Our Teddy had the same weakness, and I was so
positive that this was he that I called him by name.</p>

<p>In a moment he came to me and was on my knee&mdash;it
was indeed Teddy.</p>

<p>Now, here was one of the most unique situations on
record.</p>

<p>"This is my cat," I said demandingly.</p>

<p>"It is ours," said the chorus of children's voices.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to me that Teddy was in the
habit of leaving home and would be absent for several
days at a time. Could it be possible he had two
homes? Did this cat actually accept the affections
and hospitality of two distinct families, at the same
time, without once breathing the truth or giving himself
away?</p>

<p>I went home puzzled to my wife and said:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Teddy is not all ours?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>I was just about to tell my strange story when I
awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Foolhardy_Expedition" id="Of_the_Foolhardy_Expedition"></a>Of the Foolhardy Expedition</h2>


<p>The people who inhabited this globe during
the year 1725 undoubtedly obtained a different
view of things terrestrial than we do who claim
the world's real estate in 1915, because they
had no telegraph, no telephone, no electric
light, no automobile, and no aeroplane. How
they managed to live at all is a mystery to the twentieth
century biped. Fancy having to cross the street
to your neighbor's house when you wanted to ask
him if he was going to the pioneer supper, and just
think of having no "hello girl" to flirt with. The
condition seems appalling. But what they lacked
in knowledge and in indolent conveniences we beg to
announce that they made up in foolhardiness which
they called bravery. Well, if it can be called brave
to make a needless target of oneself to a bunch of
savage Indians, why then they had the proper derivation
of the term.</p>

<p>From one of Francis Parkman's admirable works
we have seized upon the scene of our story, which was
acted out at the beginning of the eighteenth century,
namely, 1725. The Indians seem to have been very
hostile in those early days in the immediate vicinity
of the early New England provinces; and we are convinced
some of the white men were very hostile as
well. Of course we, in our day, cannot blame them&mdash;<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 128]</span></a>they
had no telephones, autos, electricity, "hello
girls"&mdash;they had to be something, so they were hostile
towards the Indians.</p>

<p>Dunstable was a town on the firing line of Massachusetts,
and was attacked by Indians in the autumn
of 1724, and two men were carried off. Ten others
went in pursuit, but fell into an ambush, and nearly
all were killed. But now we will follow the words of
Francis Parkman, who has a delightful way of relating
his stories.</p>

<p>"A company of thirty was soon raised." They
were to receive two shillings and sixpence per day
each, "out of which he was to maintain himself";&mdash;very
little to risk one's life for; but in those days it
was no concern with a man whether he was killed or
not. Besides, it was worth something to get killed
and have Francis Parkman write about you more
than a century later. Perhaps they anticipated this
perpetuation of their names and deeds.</p>

<p>However, "Lovewell was chosen captain; Farwell
lieutenant, and Robbins, ensign. They set out towards
the end of November, and reappeared at Dunstable
early in January, bringing one prisoner and
one scalp." It does not seem to us to have paid the
interest on the investment of two shillings and sixpence
per day, "out of which he was to maintain
himself," and, for anything we know to the contrary,
perhaps the captain was getting more than this&mdash;it
has not been recorded. "Towards the end of the
month Lovewell set out again, this time with eighty-seven
men. They ascended the frozen Merrimac,
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 129]</span></a>passed Lake Winnepesaukee, pushed nearly to the
White Mountains, and encamped on a branch of the
upper Saco. Here they killed a moose&mdash;a timely
piece of luck, for they were in danger of starvation,
and Lovewell had been compelled by want of food
to send back a good number of his men. The rest
held their way, filing on snowshoes through the deathlike
solitude that gave no sign of life except the light
track of some squirrel on the snow, and the brisk note
of the hardy little chickadee, or black-capped titmouse,
so familiar in the winter woods."</p>

<p>Now here is where the foolhardiness of the expedition
begins to appeal to us. Supposing just here they
had met five hundred crazy Indians with five hundred
crazy bows and arrows? And they must have expected
it. They were searching for Indians. Perhaps
they were seeking martyrdom? But the New
Englander of the frontier was nothing if not foolhardy.
They mistook it for bravery, and there must
have been some bravery amalgamated with it, because
a man must have a certain quantity of that rarity
before he can lend himself out as a target at two
shillings and sixpence a day, "out of which he was
to maintain himself."</p>

<p>Now, if you have patience to follow you will learn
that they ultimately met the very thing which you
expect&mdash;which they must have expected.</p>

<p>"Thus far the scouts had seen no human footprints;
but on the twentieth of February they found
a lately abandoned wigwam, and following the snowshoe
tracks that led from it&mdash;" Right into the lion's
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 130]</span></a>jaw, as it were. Perhaps they were anxious to be
shot to get out of their misery&mdash;"at length saw
smoke rising at a distance out of the gray forest."
They saw their finish, and their hearts were filled
with joy. "The party lay close till two o'clock in the
morning; then, cautiously approaching, found one or
more wigwams, surrounded them, and killed all the
inmates, ten in number." They were to pay dear for
this, as anyone could have told them. "They brought
home the scalps in triumph, ... and Lovewell
began at once to gather men for another hunt....
At the middle of April he had raised a band of forty-six."
One of the number was Seth Wyman, ... a
youth of twenty-one, graduated at Harvard College,
in 1723, and now a student of theology. Chaplain
though he was, he carried a gun, knife and hatchet
like the others, and not one of the party was more
prompt to use them.... They began their
march on April 15th." After leaving several of their
number by the way for various causes, we find thirty-seven
of them on the night of May 7th near Fryeburg
lying in the woods near the northeast end of Lovewell's
pond.</p>

<p>"At daybreak the next morning, as they stood bareheaded,
listening to a prayer from the young chaplain,
they heard the report of a gun, and soon after
an Indian.... Lovewell ordered his men to
lay down their packs and advance with extreme caution."
Why this caution? "They met an Indian
coming towards them through the dense trees and
bushes. He no sooner saw them than he fired at the
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 131]</span></a>leading men." Naturally. We should have said
"leading targets." "His gun was charged with
beaver shot and he severely wounded Lovewell and
young Whiting; on which Seth Wyman shot him
dead, and the chaplain and another man scalped him."
As yet they had only entered the lion's den. "And
now follows one of the most obstinate and deadly
bush-fights in the annals of New England....
The Indians howled like wolves, yelled like enraged
cougars, and made the forest ring with their whoops....
The slaughter became terrible. Men fell
like wheat before the scythe. At one time the Indians
ceased firing; ... they seemed to be holding a
'pow-wow'; but the keen and fearless Wyman crept
up among the bushes, shot the chief conjurer, and
broke up the meeting. About the middle of the afternoon
young Fry received a mortal wound. Unable
to fight longer, he lay in his blood, praying from time
to time for his comrades in a faint but audible voice."
One, Keys, received two wounds, "but fought on till
a third shot struck him." He declared the Indians
would not get his scalp. Creeping along the sandy
edge of the pond, he chanced to find a stranded
canoe, pushed it afloat, rolled himself into it, and
drifted away before the wind. Soon after sunset the
Indians drew off.... The surviving white men
explored the scene of the fight.... Of the thirty-four
men, nine had escaped without serious injury,
eleven were badly wounded, and the rest were dead or
dying.... Robbins, as he lay helpless, asked one
of them to load his gun, saying, 'The Indians will
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 132]</span></a>come in the morning to scalp me, and I'll kill another
of them if I can.' They loaded the gun and left him."
The expected had occurred. Most of them had been
killed. Anyone could have told them this before they
set out&mdash;they could have made the same prophecy for
themselves. And after all they had accomplished
nothing but their own deaths. The story of their
return rivals that of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.
Of the whole number eleven ultimately reached home.
We leave it to the reader to determine whether this
was an exhibition of bravery or foolhardiness, or a
mixture of both.</p>

<p>We congratulate ourselves that we did not live on
the frontier of New England in the year 1725.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_Laws_of_Lycurgus" id="Of_the_Laws_of_Lycurgus"></a>Of the Laws of Lycurgus</h2>


<p>Lycurgus reigned over a place called Laced&aelig;mon,
which is a part of Greece, about the year 820 B.C.
Now, this is a great many years ago, and is further
back into the archives of history than most of us can
remember. There is no doubt, however, that this
great ruler, Lycurgus, was crazy, or he was one of
those persons whose brains cease to develop after they
have left their teens. He certainly secures the first
prize as a "whim" strategist. In spite of his insane
eccentricities, he was allowed the full exercise of his
freedom. Had he flourished in 1915 A.D. instead of
820 "B.C." (which does not mean British Columbia),
the asylum for the insane at New Westminster
would not have been strong enough to retain him.
Lycurgus did one redeeming thing&mdash;he founded a
Senate; "which, sharing,"&mdash;we are following Plutarch&mdash;"as
Plato says, in the power of the kings, too
imperious and unrestrained before, and having equal
authority with them, was the means of keeping them
within bounds of moderation, and highly contributed
to the preservation of the State. The establishment
of a Senate, an intermediate body, like ballast, kept
it in just equilibrium, and put it in a safe posture:
the twenty-eight senators adhering to the kings whenever
they saw the people too encroaching, and on the
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 134]</span></a>other hand, supporting the people, when the kings attempted
to make themselves absolute."</p>

<p>Now, what in the world possessed this despotic
imbecile to form a senate? His action in this can
only be accounted for in the light that it was one of
those unpremeditated whims of a narrow-minded
faddist. One naturally wonders what the newly
created senators were doing while the king was imposing
his insane laws. This body was formed for
the "preservation of the state." The wonder is that
there was any state left, for the king paralyzed commerce,
smothered ambition, choked art to death, and
placed a ban on modesty. Further than having been
"formed," the "Senate" never again appears on the
pages of the "Lycurgus" book.</p>

<p>Plutarch, who lived in Greece about the year 100
A.D., nine hundred years after the subject of his
biography, relates the forming and imposing of those
laws with the utmost faith, and the most implicit
innocence; which goes to prove that the Grecian idea
of government, with all its knowledge, had not advanced
much, at least up to the time of Plutarch.</p>

<p>And now for the laws.</p>

<p>"A second and bolder political enterprise of Lycurgus
was a new division of the lands. For he
found a prodigious inequality; the city overcharged
with many indigent persons, who had no land; and
the wealth centred in the hands of the few. Determined,
therefore, to root out the evils of insolence,
envy, avarice, and luxury, and those distempers of a
state still more inveterate than fatal&mdash;I mean poverty
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 135]</span></a>and riches&mdash;he persuaded them to cancel all former
divisions of land and to make new ones, in such a
manner as they might be perfectly equal in their possessions
and way of living.</p>

<p>His proposal was put in practice.</p>

<p>"After this he attempted to divide also the movables,
in order to take away all appearance of inequality;
but he soon perceived that they could not
bear to have their goods taken directly from them,
and therefore took another method, counterworking
their avarice by a stratagem."</p>

<p>Now, this seems to be the only law to which they
made objection; and this proves that the love of personal
"icties" has very deep roots. Perhaps the
influence of the "senate" sustained them in this,
for qualifications for a senator, even in those days,
must have called for men of some means, and they,
when the shoe began to pinch their own feet, would
not care to divide up their sugar and flour with the
rank and file. It does not appear, however, that they
had any say in the matter, and, beyond the statement
that they were formed for a purpose, they seem to
have taken no part in the affairs of state; if they had,
Lycurgus and his laws would never have been made
part of history.</p>

<p>"First he stopped the currency of the gold and
silver coin"&mdash;thus he paralyzed industry&mdash;"and
ordered that they should make use of iron money
only; then to a great quantity and weight of this he
assigned but a small value.... In the next place
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 136]</span></a>he excluded unprofitable and superfluous arts....
Their iron coin would not pass in the rest of Greece,
but was ridiculed and despised, so that the Spartans
had no means of purchasing any foreign or curious
wares, nor did any merchant ship unlade in their
harbor." Even Plutarch sees nothing suicidal in all
this voluntary isolating of themselves from the main
arteries of commerce.</p>

<p>"Desirous to complete the conquest of luxury and
exterminate the love of riches, he introduced a third
institution, which was wisely enough and ingeniously
contrived. This was the use of public tables, where
all were to eat in common of the same meat, and such
kinds of it as were appointed by law. At the same
time they were forbidden to eat at home, or on expensive
couches and tables.... Another ordinance
levelled against magnificence and expense, directed
that the ceilings of houses should be wrought
with no tool but the axe, and the doors with nothing
but the saw. Indeed, no man could be so absurd as to
bring into a dwelling so homely and simple, bedsteads
with silver feet, purple coverlets, or golden cups." Thus
he smothered art and personal ambition, two of the
most requisite essentials to a people on their onward
and upward trend to civilization and success. "A
third ordinance of Lycurgus was, that they should
not often make war against the same enemy, lest, by
being frequently put upon defending themselves, they
too should become able warriors in their turn."</p>

<p>And thus he made them defenceless against their
enemies.</p><p><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 137]</span></a></p>

<p>"For the same reason he would not permit all that
desired to go abroad and see other countries, lest they
should contract foreign manners, gain traces of a
life of little discipline, and of a different form of
government. He forbade strangers, too, to resort to
Sparta who could not assign a good reason for their
coming!"</p>

<p>Improvement with Lycurgus means retrogression
with us. He wished, perhaps ignorantly, to arrest
the progress of civilization and substitute a slovenly
ideal of his own. His purpose was to cancel the civilization
which the race had gained during thousands
of years of effort, and bring it back to a semi-savagery.
But the world was too big for him. It had things in
view which were too great for his small, hampered
mind to have any suspicion of. No doubt he was
sincere in his little, infinitesimal way; but it is a
blessing for the world that his influence was confined
to a very small corner of the then civilized world, and
that others of broader views succeeded him to manage
the affairs of states and nations. With all deference
to old Plutarch, the biographer of Lycurgus, we wish
to say that however grand the laws of this man may
have been as ideals, they were utter failures when
brought into practice.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_Joan_of_Arc" id="Of_Joan_of_Arc"></a>Of Joan of Arc</h2>


<p>Some people say the world is getting no better, but
if we take a dip into history and consider the conditions
which prevailed there from the earliest times
up to only a few hundred years ago, we will find a
race of human beings which in no wise resemble the
present output except in form and stature. And our
own forefathers&mdash;the people of the British Isles, the
Anglo-Saxons who are to-day leading in the social
world&mdash;were not one iota better throughout those
pages than many of the smallest and most unpretentious
of obscure tribes living here and there in ignorant,
local isolation. One of the strongest points in
our argument is the fact that history, as we have it,
is composed of the clang of battles and the private
lives of kings and despots. The ordinary, everyday
life of the peasant people&mdash;the working classes&mdash;the
backbone of the nation, so to speak&mdash;was beneath the
consideration of the historian throughout all times.
The only virtue, in his estimation, was a strong arm&mdash;a
large army to murder and destroy property. And
the life of the historian must needs reflect that of the
people. There is no doubt that in a great majority
they were of a cruel, murderous nature. We get rare
glimpses, however (at intervals of sometimes hundreds
of years), of the doings, manners, and customs,
likes and dislikes of the common people, that we can
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 139]</span></a>rely upon as authentic; the rest is poetry and legend,
and, although typical, are relations of incidents that
did not really occur.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that, although it has been withheld,
there was a great deal of virtue, which blushed
and bloomed unseen, amid all this blood and war.</p>

<p>As though by accident the historian who immortalized
Joan of Arc has let slip a few words in connection
with this heroine's early life that are more valuable
to us than page upon page of some of our so-called
history. "Jeanne d'Arc was the child of a laborer of
Domremy, a little village on the borders of Lorraine
and Champagne. Just without the cottage where she
was born began the great woods of the Vosges, where
the children of Domremy drank in poetry and legend
from fairy ring and haunted well, hung their flower
garlands on the sacred trees and sang songs to the
good people who might not drink of the fountain
because of their sins. Jeanne loved the forest; its
birds and beasts came lovingly to her at her childish
call. But at home men saw nothing in her but 'a
good girl,' simple and pleasant in her way, spinning
and sewing by her mother's side while the other girls
went to the fields&mdash;tender to the poor and sick."</p>

<p>This is a little domestic scene of the year A.D.
1425, and how homelike and real and familiar it all
is. What a sweet peace spot, among all the bloodshed
and horror that was going on throughout France
at that time.</p>

<p>Joan of Arc is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable
characters in all history. She was born at
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 140]</span></a>Domremy, France, in 1412, and was executed in
1431. Before she had reached twenty this girl had
practically freed France from the English, or at
least put the country upon such a footing that a few
years accomplished its freedom.</p>

<p>The superstitions of the times are no doubt responsible
to a great extent for the success which was
attained by this Maid of Orleans. "The English
believed in her supernatural mission as firmly as the
French did, but they thought her a sorceress who had
come to overthrow them by her enchantments," and
so on. The fact remains that this innocent peasant
girl of eighteen years of age freed France from the
English and accomplished things which no man of
France at that time was able to do. Either the French
generalship of the times was very incompetent or the
army was very much demoralized&mdash;at all events they
had been awaiting the advent of a leader who was
both determined and fearless, for skill does not seem
to have been a requisite&mdash;and this appeared in the
person of Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that an entirely inexperienced
person of this kind could take charge of an
army of ten thousand men and lead them to victory
when the best trained generals of the time could do
nothing and suffered defeat at every turn.</p>

<p>With the coronation of the King the Maid felt
that her errand was over. "Oh, gentle king, the
pleasure of God is done," she cried, as she flung herself
at the feet of Charles, and asked leave to go home.
"Would it were His good will," she pleaded with the
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 141]</span></a>archbishop, as he forced her to remain, "that I might
go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and
my brothers; they would be glad to see me again."</p>

<p>But the policy of the French court detained her.
France was depending on one of its peasant girls for
its very national existence. The humiliation of the
thing should make all good Frenchmen blush with
shame. So she fought on with the conviction that
she was superfluous in the army, and a slave to the
French court. It does not appear that she was even
placed upon the payroll, or that she received reward of
any kind for her services&mdash;and there were no "Victoria
crosses" in those days. She fought on without
pay; rendered all her services for nothing&mdash;perhaps
for the love of the thing. During the defence of Compiegne
in May, 1430, she fell into the hands of one
Vendome, who sold her to the Duke of Burgundy.
Burgundy sold her to the English&mdash;her remuneration
for her self-sacrificing, voluntarily-given services.</p>

<p>And now comes the tragic part of a most pathetic
story enacted out at a time when the name civilization,
applied to the French and English, is a mockery.
"In December she was carried to Rouen, the headquarters
of the English, heavily fettered, and flung
into a gloomy prison, and at length, arraigned before
the spiritual tribunal of the Bishop of Beauvais, a
wretched creature of the English, as a sorceress and
a heretic, while the dastard she had crowned king
left her to die." She was not even granted a legal,
judicial trial.</p><p><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 142]</span></a></p>

<p>Some say that her sentence was at one time commuted
to perpetual imprisonment, which proves that
there was a glimmer of humanity hid away in some
corner of the world, knocking hysterically in its imprisonment
for admission. "But the English found
a pretext to treat her as a criminal and condemned
her to be burned." And at this juncture it may be
well to say that we have good reason to be proud of
ourselves to-day, and ashamed of our ancestors.</p>

<p>"She was brought to the stake on May 30th, 1431.
The woman's tears dried upon her cheeks, and she
faced her doom with the triumphant courage of the
martyr." During her last awful moments, as she
left this world with the torture of the flames slowly
consuming her body, what were the last impressions
of this girl of nineteen who left home and happiness
to free a people who allowed her to be thus tormented
to death? "A court was constituted by Pope Calixtus
III., in 1455, which declared her innocent and
pronounced her trial unjust. And through the whole
civilized world her memory is fittingly commemorated
in statuary and literature." But this is poor
consolation and does not undo the mischief. So far
as Joan of Arc is concerned, she is still burning,
scorching, suffering at that stake, and the world and
the English are her torturers, still tormenting her,
while the man she made king stands looking on indifferently,
heartlessly. All the honor and statuary
that ever had creation on this green earth cannot
atone for this crime of "civilization" on the innocent.
But it is only one blot of many with which the
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 143]</span></a>world moves on, branded indelibly to its unknown
end; and beneath a pleasant exterior we know, but
try to hide, those blots, with apologies for our ancestors.
And yet some say the world is getting no
better. Out of this chaos of blood, crime and heathendom
we sprang with all our pride and greatness, and
with such a record it behooves us to be rather humble
than high-minded, for crime and disgrace are lying
at our very door-step.</p>

<p>"The story of Joan has been a rich motive in the
world of art, and painter and sculptor have spent
their genius on the theme without as yet adequately
realizing its simple grandeur."</p>

<h2><a name="Of_Voices_Long_Dead" id="Of_Voices_Long_Dead"></a>Of Voices Long Dead</h2>


<p>The following is not history, although we have
placed it under this heading. It is the literal translation
of a poem by Theocritus, a light in the ancient
literature of the Greeks. Although the actual incident
never occurred, it is typical of what was going
on among that long dead people, and it is of as much
importance to us as the most valuable record of history,
and is of vital interest when viewed in retrospect
from the year 1915, because it gives us a rare
glimpse into the domestic manners of a people who
lived when all the present civilized world was in the
hands of savages&mdash;and how modern it all seems. The
scene might have been enacted yesterday even to the
smallest detail.</p>

<p>Imagine yourself in the city of Alexandria about
the year 280 B.C.</p>

<p>"Some Syracusan women staying at Alexandria,
agreed, on the occasion of a great religious solemnity&mdash;the
feast of Adonis&mdash;to go together to the palace of
King Ptolemy Philadelphus, to see the image of
Adonis, which the Queen Arsinoe, Ptolemy's wife,
had had decorated with peculiar magnificence. A
hymn, by a celebrated performer, was to be recited
over the image. The names of the two women are
Gorgo and Praxinoe; their maids, who are mentioned
in the poem, are called Eunoe and Eutychis.
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 145]</span></a>Gorgo comes by appointment to Praxinoe's house to
fetch her, and there the dialogue begins."</p>

<p>We are following the translation of William
Cleaver Wilkinson.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gorgo.</span> Is Praxinoe at home?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Praxinoe.</span> My dear Gorgo, at last! Yes, here I
am. Eunoe, find a chair&mdash;get a cushion for it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> It will do beautifully as it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Do sit down.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Oh, this gadabout spirit! I could hardly get
to you, Praxinoe, through all the crowd and all the
carriages. Nothing but heavy boots, nothing but
men in uniform. And what a journey it is! My
dear child, you really live too far off.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> It is all that insane husband of mine. He has
chosen to come out here to the end of the world, and
take a hole of a place&mdash;for a house it is not&mdash;on purpose
that you and I might not be neighbors. He is
always just the same&mdash;anything to quarrel with one!
anything for spite!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> My dear, don't talk so of your husband before
the little fellow. Just see how astonished he looks
at you. Never mind, Zopyrio, my pet, she is not
talking about papa.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Good heavens! the child does really understand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Pretty papa!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> That pretty papa of his the other day (though
I told him beforehand to mind what he was about),
when I sent him to shop to buy soap and rouge,
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 146]</span></a>he brought me home salt instead&mdash;stupid, great, big,
interminable animal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Mine is just the fellow to him.... But
never mind; get on your things and let us be off to the
palace to see the Adonis. I hear the queen's decorations
are something splendid.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> In grand people's houses everything is grand.
What things you have seen in Alexandria! What a
deal you will have to tell anybody who has never been
here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Come, we ought to be going.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Every day is holiday to people who have
nothing to do. Eunoe, pick up your work; and take
care, lazy girl, how you leave it lying about again;
the cats find it just the bed they like. Come, stir yourself;
fetch me some water, quick! I wanted the water
first, and the girl brings me the soap. Never mind,
give it me. Not all that, extravagant! Now pour
out the water&mdash;stupid! why don't you take care of
my dress? That will do. I have got my hands
washed as it pleases God. Where is the key of the
large wardrobe? Bring it here&mdash;quick!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Praxinoe, you can't think how well that dress,
made full, as you've got it, suits you. Tell me, how
much did it cost?&mdash;the dress by itself, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Don't talk of it, Gorgo; more than eight
guineas of good hard money. And about the work
on it I have almost worn my life out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Well, you couldn't have done better.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Thank you. Bring me my shawl, and put my
hat properly on my head&mdash;properly. No, child (to
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 147]</span></a>her little boy), I am not going to take you; there is
a bogey on horseback, who bites. Cry as much as you
like, I'm not going to have you lamed for life. Now
we'll start. Nurse, take the little one and amuse
him; call the dog in, and shut the street door. (They
go out.) Good heavens! what a crowd of people!
How on earth are we ever to get through all this?
They are like ants&mdash;you can't count them. My
dearest Gorgo, what will become of us? Here are
the Royal Horse Guards. My good man, don't ride
over me! Look at that bay horse rearing bolt upright;
what a vicious one! Eunoe, you mad girl, do
take care!&mdash;that horse will certainly be the death of
the man on his back. How glad I am now that I left
the child at home!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> All right, Praxinoe, we are safe behind them,
and they have gone on to where they are stationed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Well, yes, I begin to revive again. From the
time I was a little girl I have had more horror of
horses and snakes than of anything in the world. Let
us get on; here's a great crowd coming this way upon
us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> (to an old woman). Mother, are you from the

<p><span class="speaker">Old Woman.</span> Yes, my dears.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Has one a tolerable chance of getting there?</p>

Troy by dint of trying hard; trying will do anything

gates!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Tremendous! Take hold of me, Gorgo, and
you, Eunoe, take hold of Eutychis!&mdash;tight hold, or
you'll be lost. Here we go in all together. Hold
tight to us, Eunoe. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Gorgo, there's my scarf torn right in two. For
heaven's sake, my good man, as you hope to be saved,
take care of my dress!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Stranger.</span> I'll do what I can, but it doesn't depend
upon me.</p>

are all of us the right side of the door, as the bridegroom
said when he had locked himself in with the

might wear it in heaven!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Heavenly patroness of needle-women, what

your incessant chatter. Like turtles, you go on forever.
They are enough to kill one with their broad
lingo&mdash;nothing but a, a, a.</p>

is it to you if we are chatterboxes? Order about your
own servants. Do you give orders to Syracusan
women? If you want to know, we came originally
from Corinth, as Bellerophon did; we speak Peloponnesian.
I suppose Dorian women may be allowed
to have a Dorian accent.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">P.</span> Oh, honey-sweet Proserpine, let us have no
more masters than the one we've got! We don't the

nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">G.</span> Be quiet, Praxinoe! That first-rate singer,
the Argive woman's daughter, is going to sing the
Adonis hymn. She is the same who was chosen to
sing the dirge last year. We are sure to have something
first rate from her. She is going through her
airs and graces ready to begin.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And here the voices die away in the remote past.
How difficult it is to believe that this dialogue took
place more than two thousand years ago!</p>

<p>As a last glimpse of such a beautiful, modernly
remote gem of conversation, we will give a few more
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]</span></a>words to show what those ancient gossipy ladies
thought of their husbands.</p>

<p>The following are the last surviving words which
Gorgo gave to the world:</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gorgo.</span> Praxinoe, certainly women are wonderful
things. That lucky woman, to know all that; and
luckier still to have such a voice! And now we must
see about getting home. My husband has not had
his dinner. That man is all vinegar, and nothing
else; and if you keep him waiting for his dinner he's
dangerous to go near. Adieu! precious Adonis, and
may you find us all well when you come next year!</p>

<p>He might have been a husband of yesterday!</p>

<p>For how many years have the husbands been coming
home from work daily to partake of a meal which
an attentive and tender wife has prepared for him?
This was twenty-two hundred years ago.</p>

<h2><a name="Of_the_White_Woman_Who" id="Of_the_White_Woman_Who"></a>Of the White Woman Who<br />
Became an Indian Squaw</h2>


<p>The early history of the northwest frontier of
Massachusetts is fraught with blood-curdling tales of
savage invasions against the home-builders and empire-makers
of that once troubled boundary between
the French of Canada and the English of the New
England States, but there is not a more pitiful story
than that which has been recorded touching the
Williams family of Deerfield, who were captured by
the Indians during one of their inroads in the year
1704. John Williams was a minister who had come
to Deerfield when it was still suffering from the ruinous
effects of King Philip's war. His parishioners
built him a house, he married, and had eight children.
The story of the Indians' invasion, the destruction of
the village, and the capture of over one hundred
prisoners is admirably told by Francis Parkman in
one of those excellent works of his dealing with the
old r&eacute;gime of Canada and New England.</p>

<p>"A war party of about fifty Canadians and two
hundred Indians left Quebec about mid-winter, and
arrived at Deerfield on the 28th of February, 1704.
Savage and hungry, they lay shivering under the
pines till about two hours before dawn the following
morning; then, leaving their packs and their snow<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 152]</span></a>shoes
behind, they moved cautiously towards their
prey. The hideous din startled the minister, Williams,
from his sleep. Half naked, he sprang out of
bed, and saw, dimly, a crowd of savages bursting
through the shattered door. With more valor than
discretion he snatched a pistol that hung at the head
of the bed, cocked it and snapped it at the breast of
the foremost Indian. It missed fire. Amid the
screams of his terrified children, three of the party
seized him and bound him fast, for they came well
provided with cords, as prisoners had a great market
value. Nevertheless, in the first fury of their attack,
they dragged to the door and murdered two of the
children. They kept Williams shivering in his shirt
for an hour, while a frightful uproar of yells, shrieks,
and gunshots sounded from within. At length they
permitted him, his wife, and five remaining children
to dress themselves. After the entire village had been
destroyed and the inhabitants either murdered or
made captive, Williams and his wife and family were
led from their burning house across the Connecticut
River to the foot of the mountain, and the following
day the march north began with the hundred or more
prisoners."</p>

<p>The hardships of the prisoners, and the crimes of
the victors during that long and arduous march north
through snow and ice, forms a chapter of pathos in
the early history of those eastern states.</p>

<p>"At the mouth of the White River the party
divided, and the Williams family were separated and
carried off in various directions. Eunice, the young<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 153]</span></a>est
daughter, about eight years old, was handed over
by the Indians to the mission at St. Louis on their arrival
there, and although many efforts were made on
the part of the Governor, who had purchased and befriended
Williams, to ransom her, the Jesuits flatly
refused to give her up. On one occasion he went himself
with the minister to St. Louis. This time the
Jesuits, whose authority within their mission seemed
almost to override that of the Governor himself,
yielded so far as to allow the father to see his
daughter, on condition that he spoke to no other
English prisoner. He spoke to her for an hour, exhorting
her never to forget her catechism, which she
had learned by rote. The Governor and his wife
afterwards did all in their power to procure her ransom,
but of no avail.</p>

<p>"'She is there still,' writes Williams two years
later, 'and has forgotten to speak English.' What
grieved him still more, Eunice had forgotten her
catechism." But now we come to this strange transformation,
unprecedented, we think, which made an
Indian squaw out of a white woman. "Eunice, reared
among Indian children, learned their language and
forgot her own; she lived in a wigwam of the Caughnawagas,
forgot her catechism, was baptized in the
Roman Catholic faith, and in due time married an
Indian of the tribe, who henceforth called himself
Williams. Thus her hybrid children bore her family
name.</p>

<p>"Many years after, in 1740, she came, with her
husband, to visit her relatives at Deerfield, dressed
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 154]</span></a>as a squaw and wrapped in an Indian blanket. Nothing
would induce her to stay, though she was persuaded
on one occasion to put on a civilized dress and
go to church, after which she impatiently discarded
her gown and resumed her blanket."</p>

<p>Could a sadder instance of degeneration be written
in the annals of the human family? "She was kindly
treated by her relatives, and no effort was made to
detain her. She came again the following year,
bringing two of her children, and twice afterwards
she repeated the visit. She and her husband were
offered land if they would remain, but she positively
refused, saying it would endanger her soul. She
lived to a great age, a squaw to the last. One of her
grandsons became a missionary to the Indians of
Green Bay, Wisconsin."</p>

<p>This is one of the most drastic instances of a
woman's devotion to husband, and mother love for
children driving her back to the forest of her ancestors,
and making her sacrifice all that her race had
gained for her during thousands of years. Thus the
most natural and primitive instincts of the human
race will prevail against all our arts, science and
accomplishments.</p>

<p>After all it is not money we want so much as something
to do.</p>

<p>Every man should have an accomplishment of some
kind.</p>

<p>Some music is like a jumble of misplaced notes.</p>

<p>If you have reached forty and have done nothing,
get busy.</p>

<p>We sometimes lose dollars by being too careful
with our cents.</p>

<p>We should try to arrange ourselves so that we will
appear as plausible as possible to posterity.</p>

<p>We must have something to worry about or we will
become stagnant.</p>

<p>Music should be rendered slowly and softly so that
each note may have time to tell its story before the
next one comes on the stage.</p><p><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 158]</span></a></p>

<p>When we are young our time is all present. When
we are old there is no present, but our time becomes
the aggregate days and years.</p>

<p>We sometimes get into trouble trying to keep out
of it.</p>

<p>It is not what we would <i>like</i> to do, but what we
<i>can</i> do.</p>

<p>Let us take our medicine philosophically.</p>

<p>A dollar looks larger going out than it does coming
in.</p>

<p>What is that we see falling like grain before the
reaper? It is the days, and the weeks, and the
months, and the years.</p>

<p>Every dog wonders why the other dog was born.</p>

<p>We are so constituted in temperament that one
may love what the other hates.</p>

<p>A face is like a song, it has to be learned to be
thoroughly appreciated. You have to acquire a taste
for it, and when it is once memorized it is never forgotten.</p>

<p>Most of our best words are derived from dead,
heathen languages.</p><p><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 159]</span></a></p>

<p>If you have married the wrong man, or the wrong
woman, cheer up and be a philosopher over it. Philosophy
is a good substitute for love if properly applied.</p>

<p>If you do not go about sniffing the air you will not
find so many obnoxious odors.</p>

<p>If you have a mental wound of any kind, do not
mind; time, the great healer, will cure it.</p>

<p>We despise the ancient heathen, yet in some cases
we have risen from his ashes.</p>

<p>A woman dresses for appearance, not for comfort.</p>

<p>An ounce of domestic harmony is worth a ton of
gold.</p>

<p>We should adjust ourselves as much as possible to
circumstances.</p>

<p>It is better to be a dummy than to be a gossip.</p>

<p>Every man thinks <i>his</i> dog is an angel.</p>

<p>It is not always the one who can afford it who keeps
the hired servant.</p>

<p>Since we can grow a new finger nail, why cannot
we grow a new finger?</p><p><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 160]</span></a></p>

<p>The mouse is destructive only from man's point of
view.</p>

<p>When a man reaches forty he usually settles down
to make the best of things.</p>

<p>Sometimes we are called cranks because we will
not be sat upon.</p>

<p>The passing of time so quickly would not be so
regrettable were life not so short.</p>

<p>A good book has no ending.</p>

<p>It is nothing to win a girl if you do not win her
love also.</p>

<p>The passing of time so quickly takes the pleasure
out of everything.</p>

<p>If you are popular, anything you say will rise into
the air like a Zeppelin. If you are unpopular anything
you say or do will sink into the ocean of oblivion
like a Titanic.</p>

<p>It is a pity we have to do so much to get so little.</p>

<p>It sometimes pays to accept a few cents on the
dollar and let it go at that.</p>

<p>Sometimes men become so parasitical to their occupation
that, were they to lose it, they would drown.</p><p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 161]</span></a></p>

<p>"Help ye one another." It pays.</p>

<p>Our mistakes keep us perpetually on the convalescence.</p>

<p>Woman is equal to man&mdash;sometimes more than
equal.</p>

<p>While the years are with you freeze on to them as
tightly as ever you can.</p>

<p>The "Give-in-to-nothing-or-nobody-for-anything"
spirit nurses a great deal of evil.</p>

<p>It takes forty years for a man to become a philosopher.
Some never graduate.</p>

<p>Our generation is to be pitied. It is living in the
most extravagant age the world has ever known.</p>

<p>When the church does not ameliorate the objectionable
dispositions of its adherents, it has failed in
its mission.</p>

<p>It is diplomacy to be on friendly terms with all
men.</p>

<p>Politics are sometimes dangerous things.</p>

<p>Be cheerful under all circumstances.</p>

<p>The human race has mounted a treadmill which it
must tread or perish.</p><p><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 162]</span></a></p>

<p>The strenuous industries of this world are man's
unconscious efforts to preserve his increasing numbers
from annihilation.</p>

<p>Courtesy in business is the best policy.</p>

<p>It takes three men's wages to sustain one family in
an up-to-date fashion.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, it is almost necessary to
be greedy and grasping.</p>

<p>To be perfectly healthy we should adopt the exercises
followed by our ancestors in climbing among the
trees.</p>

<p>It is not how much you can do or how quick you
get through it, but the care that you take and how well
you can do it.</p>

<p>It is not the gift but the giving.</p>

<p>It is quality, not quantity, that counts.</p>

<p>Do not measure a person's length by your personal
prejudices.</p>

<p>The man who never had an enemy is too good for
this world.</p>

<p>"You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot
make him drink." You can send a boy to college, but
you cannot make him think.</p><p><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 163]</span></a></p>

<p>The dog hates the cat, and the cat hates the dog,
but when they are friends there are no truer ones.</p>

<p>Just take the world as it is; take things as to be
had. Your friends may not be quite so good, your
foes not quite so bad.</p>

<p>It is the aggregate that counts.</p>

<p>The almighty dollar is getting smaller every day.</p>

<p>The one who is most jealous is the one who is
least in love.</p>

<p>Life is one thing after another&mdash;getting in between
man and his money.</p>

<p>Some men are so small that they could easily go
through the eye of a needle.</p>

<p>Often the man who is the most mean in buying is
the most extortionate in selling.</p>

<p>Some husbands have to prove their love by sending
their wives off for a month's holiday every six weeks.</p><p><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 164]</span></a></p>

<p>The cat is one of the most cleanly of animals, yet
she has never been known to take a bath.</p>

<p>"It is an ill wind," etc. The harder the times become
to others, the better they become to the sheriff.</p>

<p>Germany wants to reap where she has not sown.</p>

of our pet ambitions.</p>

<p>When the war is over it will be an easy matter to
estimate the German casualties. She had about sixty-five
millions.</p>

empty triumph.</p>

<p>One half of the war in Europe does not know what
the other half is doing.</p>

which they are not qualified.</p><p><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 165]</span></a></p>

<p>We must abandon that ancient superstition that a
dollar has any financial value.</p>

<p>Where a cat and a canary are brought up together,
the cat ultimately gets the canary.</p>

<p>If a man does not support his country during the
war, what can he expect after the war is over?</p>

<p>There is not a misunderstanding but that can be
adjusted amicably if it is gone about in the right
spirit.</p>

<p><i>Your</i> business is not the only important one.</p>

<p>It is a pity the cat would not always remain a
kitten.</p>

<p>With the bank man it is more a matter of figures
than it is of dollars.</p>

<p>To man, money is like a train going into a
tunnel. It goes in at one end and out at the other,
and leaves nothing.</p>

<p>Never judge a person's way by what the other
people say.</p>

<p>There are only two sides to business: what I.O.U.
and what U.O.I.</p>

<p>Where there is abundance there is likely to be
waste and lack of economy.</p><p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 166]</span></a></p>

<p>A one dollar contra is often used to stave off a hundred
dollar account.</p>

<p>"Every crow thinks that <i>its</i> bird is a white one,"
and every man thinks that <i>his</i> wife is the right one.</p>

<p>The hieroglyphic signature is often taken as a sign
of perfect commercial attainment.</p>

<p>Some people give and take; others are all take.</p>

<p>Blessed is the man who has no family, for he shall
inherit wealth.</p>

<p>Unlucky is the man who has children, for verily I
say unto you, they keep him broke.</p>

<p>The good Samaritan who lends his friend a dollar,
sometimes loses both the friend and the dollar.</p>

<p>The poorer a man the greater his misfortunes.</p>

<p>A great many children go to school to learn to read
novels.</p>

<p>It takes as long to become a man as it does to become
a philosopher.</p>

<p>Life is far too short judging by the time it takes
to collect some of our accounts.</p>

<p>First, steel made millionaires, then railways, then
oil, then pork; and now it is the automobile.</p><p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 167]</span></a></p>

<p>When two or three women are gathered together no
man can tell when the end will be.</p>

<p>The well-fed philosopher is likely to have a well-fed
philosophy; the under-fed one an emaciated
variety.</p>

<p>Habitual melancholy is not always a mental derangement;
it is very often a constitutional weakness.</p>

<p>Live and&mdash;let your indorser&mdash;learn.</p>

<p>The further you get into the world the less time
you have for poetry, philosophy and sentiment.</p>

<p>The doctor is a man whom we don't want to do
any business with.</p>

<p>You seldom meet an enthusiast who is not a crank
also.</p>

<p>Individually, dimensions are determined by the
proportions of the observer.</p>

<p>The modern attitude is a contempt for economy.
Conservation is a bugbear.</p>

<p>Your neighbor is not a freak because he does not
fall in line with your way of thinking.</p>

<p>When you have gained your equilibrium, you
usually find that it was not worth while getting mad
after all.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
